grub rescue error unknown filesystem i have a multiboot system set up the system has three drives multiboot is configured with windows xp windows 7 and ubuntu all on the first drive i had a lot of unpartitioned space left on the drive and was reserving it for adding other oses and for storing files there in the future one day i went ahead and downloaded partition wizard and created a logical ntfs partition from within windows 7 still some unpartitioned space left over everything worked fine until i rebooted the computer a few days later now i 'm getting error unknown filesystem grub rescue first of all i was surprised not to find any kind of help command by trying help man help h bash cmd now i 'm stuck with non-bootable system i have started researching the issue and finding that people usually recommend to boot to a live cd and fix the issue from there is there a way to fix this issue from within grub rescue without the need for live cd update by following the steps from persist commands typed to grub rescue i was able to boot to initramfs prompt but not anywhere further than that so far from reading the manual on grub rescue i was able to see my drives and partitions using ls command for the first hard drive i see the following hd0 hd0 msdos6 hd0 msdos5 hd0 msdos2 hd0 msdos1 i now know that hd0 msdos6 contains linux on it since ls hd0 msdos6 lists directories others will give error unknown filesystem update 2 after the following commands i am now getting to the boot menu and can boot into windows 7 and ubuntu but upon reboot i have to repeat these steps ls ls hd0 msdos6 set root hd0 msdos6 ls set prefix hd0 msdos6 insmod mod normal update 3 thanks shashank singh with your instructions i have simplified my steps to the following i have learned from you that i can replace msdos6 with just a 6 and that i can just do insmod normal instead of insmod mod now i just need to figure out how to save this settings from within grub itself without booting into any os set root hd0 set prefix hd0 insmod normal normal update 4 well it seems like it is a requirement to boot into linux after booting into ubuntu i have performed the following steps described in the manual sudo update-grub sudo grub-install this did not resolve the issue i still get the grub rescue prompt what do i need to do to permanently fix it i have also learned that drive numbers as in hd0 need to be translated to drive letters as in for some commands hd1 would be sdb hd2 would be sdc and so on partitions listed in grub as hd0 msdos6 would be translated to update 5 i could not figure out why the following did not fix grub sudo update-grub sudo grub-install so i downloaded boot-repair based on an answer from post that seemed to do the trick after i picked the recommended repair repairs most frequent problems option|unknown filesystem error grub rescue possible duplicate grub rescue error unknown filesystem after using testdisk i got the error message unknown filesystem error grub rescue to fix it i used boot-repair but it took too long hours i had to go to sleep and return so is there other way to fix it faster thanks|true

possible duplicate ca make awus036h work in ubuntu any help would be really appreciated problem is i finally got my brand new awus036h wireless usb dongle for x-mas and was so excited but so far i have been let down i done a pretty good amount of research before choosing the device i chose because it was supposed to work out of the box with linux so i did get the newer versions of the alfa brand wifi adapter i 'm running ubuntu and the adapter has a realtek chipset at first i could get it to connect and transfer but then the next day it would only connect show many networks available with good signals and will connect but when trying to surf it wo even load a web page even though i hated to i thought i would see what it would do in argh windows so i got a old laptop out and loaded up windows 7 installed the drivers it came with without moving the adapter from where it was before so i would have a control test it connected and was able to surf the internet like the signal strength suggested it would it was pretty darn fast so just cant understand why it will work that well under windows and wont with me in ubuntu  i know that others have it working flawlessly so if anyone out there can hold my hand a bit and help me get this fixed i would really appreciate it i refuse to install windows  thanks in advance|true

unity does load no launcher no dash appears when i login nothing happens i am presented with my desktop wallpaper no dash no launcher nothing|ubuntu v12 how do i get the bar back lspci grep vga my menu and launch bar are gone it seems almost as if there is no reason for this i started up my laptop and immediately notice the resolution is not as it should be my laptop 's resolution is 1920x1080 or something close to it the log-in screen looks far larger than it normally would after logging in i immediately notice i have no menus and no launch bar or i ca seem to access either i have about three folders on the desktop and other than the background image they are the only things in clear view i have very little experience with linux operating systems since i 've primarily used windows i 've wanted to install ubuntu on my laptop for a while now and finally got around to doing it after installing i needed to install the graphics driver which i found difficult to do especially since all the tutorials i read told me i would need to turn off the gui which i eventually figured out how to do at first i simply tried to install the driver without turning off the update just to see if i could i was hesitant about turning off the gui having confirmed that was impossible i tested the command needed to turn off the gui the command sudo lightdm stop seemed to work and i presumed sudo lightdm start would turn the gui back on however this did not work and in my panic i turned off the laptop i prayed i had done anything harmful perhaps i did turning my laptop back on i was relieved to see everything was back to normal this was prior to the problem stated in the first paragraph i tried to turn off the gui again to install the driver i had downloaded sorry i did mention it earlier the second time i tried sudo start lightdm and still nothing was happening so i turn off my laptop again without any obvious consequence thus far i gave up after a third attempt i did dare try installing the driver without first knowing i could command the gui to turn back on i left it alone for a couple of days after that occasionally getting on to do homework which surprised me to know i could i was even able to look up youtube videos unfortunately about a day or two after using the laptop for those couple of days something strange and just barely unexpected happened i booted ubuntu from the second partition on the hard drive i had to install ubuntu there due to the fact that the hard drive was already partitioned prior to even opening the box the first and smaller partition contains the windows operating system i am attempting to replace the partition it 's installed on only contain 50gb and i was hoping to wipe it clean and merge it with the ubuntu partition anyway as ubuntu booted up i notice the resolution is off when the log-in screen appears my background image which usually fits just right is zoomed in too much and the log-in window itself appeared larger than usual the menu bar at the top of the screen is also there at this time but looks weird to me still not exactly sure why and after logging in the menu bar disappears there is no menu bar no launch bar on the left side of the screen only the three folders and background image remain i kind of think my desktop looks naked lacking both menu and launch bars i right-click and go into the desktop background image menu from there i go to the display menu and try to fix my resolution hoping that might somehow bring back the menu and launch bars at this point i am flabbergasted since my laptop no longer recognizes the true limitation of its resolution the display menu claims my laptop 's max resolution is 1027x768 here is a link to a picture i took using my phone i forgot to mention or notice that i ca close the window which appears in the photo there are no exit minimize or full-screen options for any windows i open that includes terminal which i am still able to access i do know if this is something i did it 's highly probable that it is but any solution would be helpful if you notice in the photo i have only one folder and two programs that appear on my laptop 's desktop other than this there is but one more piece of additional information that may be useful i had ubuntu installed on my laptop prior to a reinstallation the installation mentioned in the paragraphs above and had a similar problem occur this problem was definitely my fault hence why i reinstalled the os i was updating during class because i thought i would have enough time but it turned out i did i was forced to pack away my laptop which had put it into mode i guess some important information was lost due to my mistake because everything i described above happened with one difference i could not right-click nor access terminal i hope i have not caused a similar problem somehow unlike that time in class i had done nothing besides attempting to install a driver the hard way no doubt and there was only a small set of updates that had successfully been completed unlike before this is partly what confuses me|true
