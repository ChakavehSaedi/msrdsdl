connection cuts borders of screen or creates blurry text ok this is an extension of another problem i had with a vga connection and an nvidia geforce gt 440 card the question has been updated to include other problems related to hdmi video and also since i have confirmed that it also affects ati video cards the explanation is the following i have a soneview 32 tv this tv has many connections including vga first reason i bought it hdmi second reason but did not have a hdmi cable at that time and dvi i have had this tv for little over a month now actually i had it to celebrate the release of ubuntu and started using it exactly on that date i know too much fan there but hey i like geek stuff i started using it with the vga cable after 2 weeks i bought an nvidia gt440 card the previous 9500gt which was using the vga connection was working correctly with no problems whatsoever i installed the gt440 and the first problem that i encountered using this latest card is mentioned here black screen on latest cards when starting the solution to this problem was to actually disconnect then connect again the vga cable this would result in the screen showing me the lightdm screen for my login if i did not disconnect then connect the cable i could be there forever thinking that there is no video signal the black screen problem was solved in a later update for and already solved using the default so using and updating or using solved the black screen with hdmi problem i got tired of looking for answers that did not work and for solutions that made me literally have to install ubuntu again i just went and bought an hdmi cable and changed the vga one for that one it worked and i did not have to the cable but now i have this problem when using any resolution my normal resolution is 1920x1080 this tv is 1080hd so in vga i could use this resolution with no problem but on hdmi am getting the borders cut out here is a pic as you can see from the image the launcher icons only show less than 50 of their width forget about the top and bottom parts i can access them with the mouse but i can not visualize them in the screen it is like it 's outside of the tvs view basically there is like 20 to 30 pixels gone from all sides i searched around and came to running xrand verbose to see what it could detect from the tv i got this xrandr verbose xrandr failed to get

what is taking up so much space on my disk beside the filesystem i have only one disk in my computer a 80 gb ssd it is formatted as a single ext4 partition no swap and all the usual folders are installed on it i keep lots of data on external media but home and all the rest is on the ssd today i booted it and i got a message that the drive is full i opened disk usage analyzer to look at what takes up space it insists that gb of the disk are used and that is taking up gb which leads to the question where are the missing 30 gb if not on the file system just to have a comparison i added up all the sizes of all readable folders listed in nautilus as subfolders of including the hidden ones i got gb trash was unreadable but i know it has gb so the sum is gb around the same as what disk usage analyzer is reporting there were some system folders which were unreadable like proc but i doubt that they add up to 30 gb else it would be possible to install ubuntu on small disks and i 've seen it run on gb i think they must be the gb difference between my calculation and the disk usage analyzer 's report so i 'd like to know what is eating up these 30 gb and how do i get it to free them edit with answers to cyrex 's questions booted from ubuntu 64 bit live cd same as my system fsck result fsck fsck from e2fsck clean files blocks booted from the sdd emptied the trash and the 16 gb from there are now free the 30 gb are still missing i am not experienced enough to know what counts as weird in a log here are my messages log and my syslog since last boot maybe you can find something in them here it got really strange i plugged in an external 500 gb hdd disk usage analyzer overreported the available space then showed space missing 76 gb used but only 24 in folders booted again from the livecd started the disk usage analyzer from it and got the same results as from the installed ubuntu within 1-2 gb edit with answer to codemonk that would have been a nice solution but the partition is really 80 gb i mean 74 gb marketing error anyway the whole disk is formatted it also shows that over 50 gb are used so where are the 30 gb if not in files and folders gparted also reports the correct size of the external hdd|why does the total space used on my hard drive not reflect what disk usage analyzer says possible duplicate what is taking up so much space on my disk beside the filesystem i 'm a bit curious as to why my hard drive space according to disk usage analyzer has 20 gb more used space than the space my files take up here 's a screenshot on it says that only gb is used but apparently gb is used i have 3 partitions on my hdd a grub partition my ubuntu partition and a 3 gb swap partition so any thoughts i really would like to know if i can make this gb shrink to the 120 gb that it should be|true

problem resolving many of the web pages i am presently running ubuntu and using along with opendns have tried google public dns as well as dns of my isp suddenly a lot of websites that i visit frequently do load anymore some of them are imgur yahoo fed-sudoku microsoft and addons page of firefox i am sure there are many more that wo load i have windows 7 in dual-boot and there are no problems whatsoever in opening these pages on windows brief history 2 weeks back i installed ubuntu i faced this issue right-away on ubuntu i thought something must have went wrong with the installation so i removed ubuntu and instead installed lubuntu on it but the same issue persisted on lubuntu as well so i tried opening these webpages in live environments of ubuntu lubuntu and ubuntu from usb the issue was there for ubuntu and lubuntu however i was able to access these webpages from ubuntu so i installed on my harddisk everything on was fine till yesterday but suddenly these sites do load anymore all this while windows 7 in dual-boot works flawlessly please help me resolve this issue updates 1 in response to zhang 's answer to check basic terminal commands i have used both opendns and googlepublic dns to test these commands restarted my pc in between these are the terminal outputs while using opendns and while using googlepublicdns 2 this is the result of ifconfig pastebin link 3 thereafter i tried to use wget to check if the problem was with the browser however it did work for webpages which are not loading in my browser this is the pastebin link showing it for google works and yahoo does work 4 then followed the instructions listed at noobslab to disable ipv6 also restarted my pc however it did help either 5 then i edited my wired connection through network-manager to ignore ipv6 after that i tried to open yahoo in browser it did load the first time however when i tried again it did load other problem sites did load at all 6 again tried wget however this time passed the argument to it ie wget but once again did get any response 7 then tried to fiddle with mtu followed this link to check what is the maximum that i can set for me the maximum possible was 10324 also tried other values like 1500 1492 1452 and 100 but this did help either 8 re-installed ubuntu wiping out the previous installation and as such all other changes also installed all the available updates for the first i was able to load all the webpages including the ones which had problem but lateron i have the same issue as earlier not able to load pages like yahoo imgur microsoft fed-sudoku 9 question by laurent from wget pastebin info in the question the problem is not dns as the wget and dig commands reach yahoo 's ip this said i do know why nothing downloads with wget have you set a firewall you can check with sudo iptables l in ifconfig results there are 2 interfaces ppp0 and eth0 which one should be used to connect to internet could you post the result of route command obs eth0 has no ipv4 address so i think it is not properly configured how is laurent reply by me here is the pastebin link for terminal outputs of sudo iptables l route and cat i am not running any firewall its a clean install of ubuntu ppp0 is used to connect to the internet this takes username and password which was given by my isp and eth0 is the intel 's onboard lan which connects the modem through ethernet port 10 tried to append nameserver line in conf since i am using opendns but this did help even after restart so reverted the changes back this is also a part of answer provided by laurent it 's required if i want to use opendns other info i have an adsl modem not a router connected to the pc with an ethernet port to connect to the internet i have a dsl connection so i use pppoe to connect terminal output for system information sudo lshw c network cat conf ifconfig a pastebin link|some webpages not opening in any browser i have using ubuntu lts with all available updates installed some websites are not opening in any browser i have tried many browsers firefox chrome chromium arora xxxtrem browser midori but yesterday i have install the ubuntu the first release of this version in my pen drive and use it in usb booted ubutu all websites are open properly or we can say that in older version of browsers websites are opening in usb booted ubuntu firefox version is but now in updated ubuntu lts websites are not opening i have read some solution about this problem but they are says to change dns server but i think this is not dns server problem because with same dns settings websites are opening properly in the windows and usb booted ubutu please tell what will be solution website which i tried to open are|true

how to remove ubuntu and put windows back on i have absolutely no experience with linux and i desperately need to get my laptop back up and running again with windows how do i remove ubuntu|what should i do if i installed ubuntu instead of just trying it help i 'm brand new to ubuntu and need some hand holding i just created a live cd of ubuntu and installed version when i think i may have been better off just trying it i started my ubuntu journey after reading a post that touted its diagnostics i 'm hoping to get a critical look under the covers of my desktop pc gigabyte mb amd phenom ii x4 965 processor 4gb ram some apps google and itunes are incredibly slow to start and although i 've confirmed with a separate iso boot cd of memtest-86 that my ram is error-free i 'm looking to learn more about this machine and why it might be running slow now that ubuntu is installed i think i need to retrace my steps and i would like to know how to do so safely i 'm not sure i 'm finding a lot of value in having another os on my machine when all i really wanted was some dependable and free diagnostics i 'm not a heavy enough user of xp to notice its flaws and although ubuntu may be wonderful and free thanks to the selfless efforts of many it represents to me at best a learning curve with little payback if i boot to ubuntu and at worst an annoyance in the form of having to bypass the ubuntu os at start-up in favor of windows xp when my wife starts using this machine that will freak her out furthermore i 'm gravely concerned that my partitioning activity during installation has somehow robbed me of otherwise usable space on my rather modest 200gb western digital drive i did not know how to tell what the partitioning slider tool was going to do how much would be allocated to ubuntu versus xp so i just left it set at the values shown during the install dialog 122gb on the left 63gb on the right hoping and thinking that the installer would automatically apportion modestly now my drive has only 63gb of usable space with the other 122gb used for something which i suspect is ubuntu so i 'm looking for some wisdom in the following areas 1 does ubuntu give the ability to critically evaluate other than memtest the condition of hardware as well as the overall health of a system registry etc etc enabling one to intelligently diagnose and correct performance issues if so are these available without installing ubuntu to those trying it 2 is there a way to safely uninstall ubuntu returning the system to windows xp only 3 if there a way either with or without uninstalling ubuntu to optimize the partition sizes of my disk to allow for maximum availability to windows xp with a modest amount allocated to ubuntu should i choose to leave it installed currently i have 122gb used and i can say with almost 100 certainty that my sparsely populated machine is naturally consuming nowhere near that amount of data rather i believe i clobbered this storage during my partitioning activity during the install 4 if i choose or am forced for practical reasons to leave ubuntu installed is there a way to default to windows xp at boot instead of to ubuntu if no keys are depressed within the allotted timeframe thanks to all who offer me advice dennis|true

installing ubuntu on a pre-installed windows 8 64-bit system uefi supported i bought a computer with windows 8 pre-installed but i did like windows 8 so i decided to install ubuntu as a second operating system i 'm absolutely new to linux i have been using windows for all my life but i have read about ubuntu and linux in general and i think i 'll like it so i wanted to know how to install ubuntu on my pc with a pre-installed windows 8 on it can i do it with wubi or through the live what steps do i need to take to correctly install ubuntu|windows 8 does allow ubuntu start-up scenario recently i build up my own desktop and decided to install as first os windows 8 why did i do that as always i have both ubuntu and windows i though that installing windows first would be better to check if my video card was working properly as drivers works better in windows problem the problem is that when i installed ubuntu after restarting the pc i wo be prompted to choose an os it simply starts windows 8 then i read about windows 8 installation and found out that it uses uefi boot as there is a partition created by windows that is efi then i tried to install ubuntu efi although i got the very same situation after that i did a last try making things manually by selecting the partition that windows created as efi partition although the installation could proceed because it did identified the efi partition as an efi partition what i want i wonder if i delete the partition that windows created as efi and let ubuntu create it 's own efi in the place will things work but if that is possible i do want windows 8 anymore in my pc i will stick with 7 and ubuntu but as i do know a lot about uefi stuff i am wondering if i just make a backup partition for my important files in ntfs system and delete all the rest and then install ubuntu and after windows 7 it will work because i do know if windows 8 configurations into the uefi bios will remain after deleting it from the hdd and it will prevent me from installing other os es and then i will be with no computer at all in addition i would like to have ubuntu and windows 7 installed both as efi systems if possible cause as far as i know it improves security correct me if i am wrong and my motherboard does support secure boot it has any option about that in the bios and i ran confirm-securebootuefi command in windows that returned that my system does support secure boot my pc specs corsair vengeance lp 8gb 2 x 4gb ddr3 1333 pc3 10666 cml8gx3m2a1333c9 gigabyte radeon hd 7970 3gb 384-bit gddr5 pci express x16 intel

new computer hangs on how to troubleshoot my system is working perfectly but it freezes during hibernate all windows and the menu bar disappear but the desktop wallpaper remains it does even show the shutdown screen the one with the animated dots where i could hit esc and watch the shutdown console text the system is brand-new and fully updated using update manager how can i determine what is causing the freeze is there a log i can investigate how can i fix this i see no obvious cause of the freeze the only usb attachment is a i do have any external storage attached and i do have any programs running the machine freezes even when doing shutdown right from the login screen what i 've tried so far based on other questions this this and this that suggest some acpi settings i 've tried sudo shutdown h now to see whether the shutdown console text display offers any hints but the system does even get that far it still freezes while the screen shown the desktop background image without any toolbars only sudo shutdown force works but that 's not a solution editing the grub menu to add acpi off to the kernel did help i guess there 's not much point in trying the other lesser acpi suggestions adding noapic to the grub entry had no discernible effect adding nolapic instead did something i had removed the quiet option the system managed to continue further with the shutdown right until the line checking for running unattended-upgrades which were the last characters on the screen i 've also checked the system bios especially regarding power options but did see anything out of the ordinary switching the bios standby setting from s3 to s1 did help the standby setting ca be disabled and there are no other acpi-related settings afaik bios reset did help not surprised had changed anything i tried going to a virtual console ctrlaltf1 as suggested by djeikyb and from there did a shutdown h now and it froze there too after this console output i did try killing processes one at a time because i 'm still too newbie to figure out how to do that booting with kernel rather than did help disabling the nvidia drivers did help booting from live cd usb stick in fact did help it freezes the same way booting from live cd with acpi off noapic nolapic did help either neither did just nolapic so evidently this is not some custom setting in my install but some sort of basic issue memtest competed in 1 hour without errors|ubuntu shutdown hanging when trying to shutdown ubuntu it shows the dialog box of shutdown but after clicking it nothing happen i have to click on the power button to shut down|true

default meaning all slots when the bit 8 0x100 is set the lower 8 bits are used as the fixed codec slots the driver probes the slots regardless what hardware reports back only probing and no codec initialization default off useful to check the initial codec status for debugging specifies the dma irq timing delay in samples passing will make the driver to choose the appropriate value based on the controller chip patch specifies the early patch files to modify the hd-audio setup before initializing the codecs this option is available only when y is set see for details selects the beep registration mode 0 off 1 on 2 dynamic registration via mute switch the default value is set via kconfig single global options use single immediate commands to communicate with codecs for debugging only enable message signaled interrupt msi default off automatic power-saving timeout in second 0 disable reset hd-audio controller in power-saving mode default on this module supports multiple cards and autoprobe see for more details about hd-audio driver each codec may have a model table for different configurations if your machine is listed there the default usually minimal configuration is set up you can pass model option to specify a certain model in such a case there are different models depending on the codec chip the list of available models is found in the model name genric is treated as a special case when this model is given the driver uses the generic codec parser without codec-patch it 's sometimes good for testing and debugging if the default configuration does work and one of the above matches with your device report it together with alsa-info sh output with no-upload option to kernel bugzilla or alsa-devel ml see the section links and addresses and options are for power-saving mode see for details note 2 if you get click noises on output try the module option 1 or 2 1 will use the register value without fifo size correction as the current dma pointer 2 will make the driver to use the position buffer instead of reading register usually register is more accurate than the position buffer nb if you get many timeout messages at loading it 's likely a problem of interrupts acpi irq routing try to boot with options like pci noacpi also you can try 1 module option this will switch the communication method between hda controller and codecs to the single immediate commands instead of basically the single command mode is provided only for bios and you wo get unsolicited events too but at least this works independently from the irq remember this is a last resort and should be avoided as much as possible more notes on timeout problems on some hardwares you may need to add a proper option to avoid the timeout problem above instead this occurs when the access to non-existing or non-working codec slot likely a modem one causes a stall of the communication via hd-audio bus you can see which codec slots are probed by enabling or simply from the file name of the codec proc files then limit the slots to probe by option for example 1 means to probe only the first slot and 4 means only the third slot the power-management is supported possible

ubuntu installer does not see windows already installed on my computer when i just tried to install ubuntu alongside windows 7 on my new hp pavilion 64k desktop with windows 7 computer ubuntu said this computer has no detected operating system and someone said i suggest you chkdsk your windows partition i also suggest you resize the ntfs in windows then install ubuntu to the free space in response i did the following to shrink a simple or spanned volume using the windows interface in disk management right-click the simple or spanned volume you want to shrink click shrink volume follow the instructions on your screen when i tried to install ubuntu again after doing that i received the same error i was going to undo what i did but i see that i lose 1g when i do that so now what do i do it says i can do a new simple volume and maybe then the space will no longer be unallocated please help me i think i have a bad ubuntu cd because from my research i see that i am not supposed to get the no detected operating system message i hope i did not mess up my computer with a bad cd please advise ok i think i am following what you said about how to edit my question irrational john i did chkdsk as you and actionparsnip andrew-woodhead666 told me to and i also did a lot of other things before i found out how to chkdsk no problems thank you then i put back the space extended i took from system i still was only able to put back 15 and not 16 so it is up to 99mb not back to 100mb then i shrank hp c as you told me to 10 mb which is gb unallocated i did not change it into ntsf by doing the new simple volume action i just left it then i tried to install from the ubuntu livecd amd64 and it gave me the results it was sometimes giving me before which is result that ubuntu does not tell me whether i have or have not an already-installed windows 7 it just goes to a window that would have showed me information on what i have and on the bottom device for boot loader installation and the options back quit or install i think it is the installation type window therefore i do what i have been doing and i quit what do i do now sorry that it seems like i can not do anything on my own on the youtube video how to install ubuntu dual-boot alongside windows ubuntu gets installed so easily the installation option page gives three options including dual installation and the disk even lets you use a slider to slide to the size of the partition size you want yet my ubuntu livecd is a mess i checked it as one of you guys told me to and got back information that it is good oh well this guy says you should press a control key to tell which device you are using to install ubuntu before the screen comes up i guess 'cause it is old this page also shows you easy stuff that do not show up on my cd how to dual-boot ubuntu and windows 7 i saw this on the windows 7 create a boot partition website to create a boot partition warning warning if you are installing different versions of windows you must install the earliest version first if you do do this your computer may become inoperable open computer management by clicking the start button picture of the start button clicking control panel clicking system and security clicking administrative tools and then double-clicking computer management administrator permission required if you 're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation type the password or provide confirmation in the left pane under storage click disk management right-click an unallocated region on your hard disk and then click new simple volume in the new simple volume wizard click next type the size of the volume you want to create in megabytes mb or accept the maximum default size and then click next accept the default drive letter or choose a different drive letter to identify the volume and then click next in the format partition dialog box do one of the following if you do want to format the volume right now click do not format this volume and then click next to format the volume with the default settings click next for more information about formatting see formatting disks and drives frequently asked questions review your choices and then click finish and i saw the following on yet another page formatting disks and drives frequently asked questions hard disks the primary storage devices on your computer need to be formatted before you can use them when you format a disk you configure it with a file system so that windows can store information on the disk hard disks in new computers running windows are already formatted if you buy an additional hard disk to expand the storage of your computer you might need to format it storage devices such as usb flash drives and flash memory cards usually come preformatted by the manufacturer so you probably wo need to format them cds and dvds on the other hand use different formats from hard disks and removable storage devices for information about formatting cds and dvds see which cd or dvd format should i use warning warning formatting erases any existing files on a hard disk if you format a hard disk that has files on it the files will be deleted what i did was i got to the computer management section then i clicked on the drive hp c and it became striped to show it was selected then i clicked on action selected all tasks and then selected shrink volume and then chose how much space from what it was giving me that i wanted gb and that was all i did then i tried to instal ubuntu i never got to the third screen that is in the video i linked earlier the youtube video with the english guy i also did not get the fourth screen that allows you to select a partition size what i got was the second installation type window shown on the linux bs page that i linked and it showed no information about any drives no or stuff was shown only the boot loader statement and the bar and that 's why i did not press install but chose to quit sorry i just now saw your answer irrational john i shrank hp c by gb my unallocated space is now gb hp c gb ntsf you are correct with everything you said this is what i read on create a boot partition you must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps a boot partition is a partition that contains the files for the windows operating system if you want to install a second operating system on your computer called a dual-boot or multiboot configuration you need to create another partition on the hard disk and then install the additional operating system on the new partition your hard disk would then have one system partition and two boot partitions a system partition is the partition that contains the hardware-related files these tell the computer where to look to start windows to create a partition on a basic disk there must be unallocated disk space on your hard disk with disk management you can create a maximum of three primary partitions on a hard disk you can create extended partitions which include logical drives within them if you need more partitions on the disk picture of disk space in computer management unallocated disk space if there is no unallocated space you will either need to create space by shrinking or deleting an existing partition or by using a third-party partitioning tool to repartition your hard disk for more information see

click next for more information about formatting see formatting disks and drives frequently asked questions review your choices and then click finish i did what you told me john and this is the screenshot i entered sudo os-prober the computer did not respond so i entered sudo apt-get y remove dmraid to which the computer responded with reading package lists done building dependency tree

the computer responded with windows 7 loader windows chain windows recovery environment loader windows1 chain i do know what a grub menu is and i do not know what the ubuntu boot option is the answer you gave to me was correct this one this apparently removes the dmraid metadata after doing that you can use the desktop icon install ubuntu lts to start the ubuntu installer this time the installation type window should contain the option to install ubuntu alongside windows 7 this is what i decided to do i did not see the rest of your help 'til now nevertheless i think the best thing

how to install revkit i 'm trying to install a software called revkit on ubuntu and the following instructions1 need to be followed revkit can be downloaded from the website opening a bash shell and assuming that the file is in the current working directory first the package needs to be unpacked tar xvfz revkit gz cd revkit then you can build the toolkit the build process is divided into two scripts first the revkit environment is created using the bootstrap script afterwards the revkit algorithms are built using the build script this has the benefit of running the second script only if changes have been made on the algorithms but not on the environment the bootstrap script should only be called once at the beginning more precisely first run the bootstrap script bootstrap this will download and compile all dependencies automatically for that purpose compiling boost takes some time if you already have installed boost using the distribution 's package manager the option dboost path can be used to specify its path dboost path usr alternatively you can specify the boost include and libs path separately by using boost and as arguments please make sure that your version of boost satisfies the requirements after bootstrapping the environment the build script needs to be executed to run this script manually call build this will build the whole revkit suite including the core algorithms examples and the python bindings the python bindings enable the cli to use revkit like a shell if the system can not build the python bindings or if they are not needed they can be deactivated by calling build dbuild bindings off instead further packages which are not available in the distribution 's package manager cudd or puma are downloaded and installed automatically from the bootstrap script boost is also required and will be downloaded and installed by default the build script must be called at least once afterwards the sources only need to be compiled again if local changes have been performed alternatively the program make can be executed manually by calling make in the build directory the build script also provides the options of enabling and disabling the compilation of unstable and example algorithms by using the parameters dbuild unstable and dbuild examples if this is correct an gui window should open in the following instructions which am not able to see revkit graphical user interface the revkit graphical user interface enables the creation and execution of customized design processes to be executed therefore a gui is utilized where the respective tasks can easily be put together by means of item blocks connected to a graph each item performs an operation and may have ports for the respective input parameters and output results input ports can be connected to output ports forming a channel when they support the same data types in order to start the revkit graphical user interface the following command has to be invoked from within the root directory of revkit  py i was able to do the first 2 instructions but after that i am unable to follow what has to be done the instructions relating to the bootstrap script can anyone tell me what exactly needs to be done basically i need to get to the gui interface which am unable to do 1revkit user manual 3 download and installation|revkit installation so i need to install this software called revkit on ubuntu below are the instructions as per the manual requirements revkit needs a couple of packages which can easily be installed with the distribution 's package manager below the commands for common distributions are listed in distri butions not listed it can be done analogue but the package names might deviate ubuntu mint linux for the python interface ubuntu or higher is required sudo apt get install build essential cmake python dev ipython python qt4 python numpy opensuse sudo zypper install gcc cmake python devel ipython python qt4 python numpy fedora sudo yum install wget gcc cmake python devel ipython pyqt4 numpy 1 2 for a description of how to extend revkit with own approaches or how to integrate revkit in own projects respectively we refer the reader to the developers documentation the developers documentation including an api is provided by means of doxygen in the sources of revkit as well as on user manual for fedora users in order to run revkit se linux needs to be disabled this can be done temporarily or permanently as follows temporarily sudo 0 permanently change enforcing to disabled in and reboot 3 download and installation revkit can be

will build the whole revkit suite including the core algorithms examples and the python bindings the python bindings enable the cli to use revkit like a shell if the system can not build the python bindings or if they are not needed they can be deactivated by calling build dbuild bindings off 3 further packages which are not available in the distrubition 's package manager as cudd or puma are downloaded and installed automatically from the bootstrap script boost is also required and will be downloaded and installed by user manual instead the build script must be called at least once afterwards the sources only need to be compiled again if local changes have been performed alternatively the program make can be executed manually by calling make in the build directory the build script also provides the options of enabling and disabling the compilation of unstable and example algorithms by using the parameters dbuild unstable and dbuild examples 4 revkit user manual after the installation revkit is fully functional and ready to use in this section we describe how to apply the most important functions using out of the box tools this should provide a starting point to become familiar with the framework and its func tionalities  revkit graphical user interface the revkit graphical user interface enables the creation and execution of customized design processes to be executed therefore a gui is utilized where the respective tasks can easily be put together by means of item blocks connected to a graph each item performs an operation and may have ports for the respective input parameters and output results input ports can be connected to output ports forming a channel when they support the same data types in order to start the revkit graphical user interface the following command has to be invoked from within the root directory of revkit  py the use of the gui is illustrated by means of several tutorial-videos at the website i tried to do it many times but was successful here 's a copy my last attempt can someone please tell me the errors that are occuring and how to rectify them i need to get the gui interface of revkit somehow if not can u describe the process in detail i 'll be really really grateful|true

configuration for crtc 262 all the other resolutions work|ca adjust resolution on a virtual ubuntu i have recently created an ubuntu virtual machine but the resolution is way off and i am not able to change it to a more appropriate size my host machine is a macbook pro running with a 1280x800 resolution my virtual machine is running ubuntu and everything except the resolution is working fine the resolution is not just not ideal but it is impossible to work with at 640x480 i have researched a lot and looked all over askubuntu but none of the answers i have found work for me and i do have guest additions installed what i have tried this seems to be a very informative and exhaustive answer yet none of the solutions he has offered have worked for me 1 use mouse to adjust screen size adjusting the screen by resizing the virtual box windows with the mouse allows for any screen resolution up to the host screen resolution i have tried that but the resolution remains the same and gray bars are added around the outside of the window 2 use predefined standard screen sizes if you need a fixed standard resolution you may also choose system settings monitors for or displays for for a selection of fixed resolutions here shown for for maximum host screen resolution you will need to run virtual box in fullscreen mode host f for a fixed host screen resolution we need to disable auto-resize guest display from virtual box manager view menu 1 the only option i have is 640x480 2 when i go to fullscreen it just makes the gray bars larger without affecting the resolution 3 auto-resize guest display is grayed out and i am unable to disable it host g also does nothing 3 define new geometry with xrandr if you need a fixed geometry that is not in the list of resolutions for monitors you will have to use xrandr to define a new resolution first we use gtf for calculating the modeline of possible resolutions gtf x give the desired values for x-resolution y-resolution and refresh rate the flag x is default and can be omitted for a portrait resolution 480x640 at 60 hz you will get the following output gtf 480 640 60 x 480x640 hz gtf hsync khz pclk mhz modeline hsync vsync from this we can copy paste the modeline to add it to xrandr list of known resolutions xrandr newmode hsync vsync and add this for the virtual box monitor xrandr addmode vbox0 replace vbox0 with the appropriate monitor if you have setup virtual box with multiple monitors or any other output name the driver reports we can now switch to the newly defined geometry as described above 2  i have done as he said there here is what i wrote in the terminal and what the terminal said back virtualbox cvt 1280 800 1280x800 hz cvt ma hsync khz pclk mhz modeline hsync vsync virtualbox xrandr newmode 1280x800 hsync

partitions for ubuntu and windows 7 dual boot on ssd hdd setup i have purchased a new ssd 120gb and i had a hdd 1tb already installed i will install both ubuntu and windows on these drives as the file space on the ssd is limited and i 've read that writing to an ssd drive is discouraged i would like to store most of the data on the hdd drive i am aiming at faster system but also keeping the valuable data safe on the more reliable hdd and expanding the life span of the ssd i have already set up windows on these drives system files and applications on ssd users folder and programdata on hdd and now it 's time to set up ubuntu so my question is which partitions i should create on which drive should they be placed and how large they should be based on my experience and articles i 've read i will probably create swap home and partitions does it seem reasonable to place swap and home partitions on the hdd and on the ssd and how large should partition be also will the applications be installed in partition if so is it rational to store the applications on separate partitions on the hdd instead of on the ssd and what should the size of the partition be in this case|installing ubuntu on a ssd and hdd system so i have this 128 gb ssd and a 1 tb hdd and i plan to install ubuntu on this system that uses them now all the info that i have found in here about similar problems are usually with limited ssd space but mine is pretty big it is a samsung 840 pro 128 gb so my question is what would be the intelligent way of partitioning my system in this case obviously the will go on ssd then home and swap will go on hdd but what else should i care about tmp and var also and move them on my hdd how much size would it be smart to allocate for them then|true

tips to extend battery life for laptops and notebooks this question is present as a matter of historical interest while you are encouraged to help maintain its answers please understand that big list questions are not generally allowed on ask ubuntu and will be closed per the faq it is possible to greatly extend the usage time of a laptop or netbook running on battery by disabling various services and installing various packages what tricks or tips do people have for getting an extra hour or two out of their batteries perhaps one tip per answer|how can i improve the battery life under on my inspiron 14z how do i improve the battery life of my inspiron 14z under ubuntu this laptop gets 4-5 hours of battery life using windows here i 've removed windows installed ubuntu and the initial battery life was only 2 hours with some tweaks described below it 's still only hours for reference the laptop is the latest model of the 14z i5-3337u processor 32gb msata 500gb hdd 5400rpm amd radeon hd7570m graphics card i have put ext4 partitions on both the ssd and the hdd and have mounted to the ssd and home to the hdd i also put a 24gb linux swap partition at the start of the hdd though i figure this wo be used all that much the laptop has 8gb of ram after googling around and reading ask ubuntu and other sites extensively i have done the following steps and they have improved the battery life 30 minutes exact improvement not clear but battery life is still nowhere near 4-5 hours installed jupiter and set performance to power saving installed cat now outputs 5 previously it output 0 but it 's not clear that this will help askubuntu question turned down the brightness of my screen from full to other things i have heard about but have not tried for fear of frying the laptop or my linux install add force at the end of the line with quiet splash in cfg enable alpm but it may already be enabled in enable i915 framebuffer compression use a propietary driver for the graphics card turn off the graphics card what would happen if i relied on the internal intel bridge use tlp spin down the hdd more aggressively howto but i think does this already the only other thing i 've noticed is that plastic just above the f5 f6 and f7 keys gets really hot according to jupiter my cpu temperature is only 69 celsius and the system monitor shows cpu load at 7 so i do think it 's the cpu maybe it 's the graphics card also i 've set up mongodb and lamp on the machine as well when i run powertop mongodb is high in the list but i 'm not sure if that 's relevant to battery life because i 'm not actually doing anything with mongodb most of the time edit additional info requested by lspci nnk grep iea3 graphics vga vga compatible controller 0300 intel corporation ivy bridge

but i could not run catalyst instead it exited with the error no amd graphics driver is installed or the amd driver is not functioning properly please install the amd driver appropriate for your amd

start mint or win7 then i wanted to install ubuntu too so i installed ubuntu on the same hard-drive as windows and here is the problem the grub-menu was the same i could choose between windows and mint but when i took windows there was a secound grub-menu where i could choose between ubuntu and windows and when i took windows again i got the error message error no such partition i thought that it would help and deleted ubuntu with gparted on mint again but the error message when i choose windows in the grub-menu is still the same the terminal command sudo grub-update did change anything the

ubuntu gets stuck in a login loop my problem as you can guess my ubuntu is stuck in a login loop when trying to enter my desktop means the screen gets black and soon after that the login screen comes back i 'm a ubuntu newbie so if there 's any answer please explain in a simply understandable language i 've already read that the problem might be caused by an error depending on the graphics so i post my graphics to my graphics ati radeon 7670m|ubuntu boots to login screen but i think crashes on login help appreciated i 've been running ubuntu since it 's debut in 2012 without a single problem today i just ran sudo apt-key update sudo apt-get update and then i rebooted my computer after rebooting however it first shows the ubuntu bootscreen with the ubuntu logo and the dots below it after which it booted to the command line i could login and navigate around on the command line but no gui was loaded at all so i tried running sudo startx but this gave a message saying among others the following nvidia api mismatch the nvidia kernel module has version but this nvidia driver component has version please make sure that the kernel modle and all nvidia driver components have the same version i found this thread which suggested to do sudo service lightdm stop to stop the xserver sudo apt-get remove purge nvidia to remove all driver elements sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install nvidia-current sudo reboot after doing this it now boots to the login screen where it seems that there are now two users named kramer65 on my computer one of the two has the default instead of my personal background and says my password is incorrect the other one seems to be my real account and when i type my password it seems to try to show the desktop instead however it shows a black screen after which i think crashes because it loads the login screen again so i guess the nvidia driver is still not okay or maybe there is something wrong with the duplicate accounts both with a username kramer65 but i guess it 's the nvidia driver does anybody know what else i can do from here all tips are welcome edit the strange thing is that i can actually login using the guest account so i do understand whats wrong with the specific kramer65 user login|true
