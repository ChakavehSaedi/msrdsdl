one monitor getting spilled over into other monitor how to do a 100 reset of gnome graphics configuration i had to kill a vmware process and afterwards my monitor 's configuration is buggy i have 2 monitors in a configuration my right-hand monitor is the secondary monitor upon its right-hand side there are about 50 pixels showing from the left side of the lefthand monitor ie as if it was wrapped around further my mouse clicks are registering as about 50 pixels sideways from where they should be it 's as if those 50 pixels between monitors got gobbled what have i done i 've reset the screen configuration in multiple ways using xrandr multiple monitors app this persists in different configurations and also persists with another user it does not occur with xfce resetting the window manager with the compiz reset wm app does not fix this i 've concluded the approach is likely the best and would like to do a 100 reset of my graphics settings it 's an intel integrated chipset removing  xml did not work also interestingly the mouse can mouse-over the 50 errant pixels on the rhs of the right-hand monitor i hypothesize that it 's a compositing problem occurring at the layer where the background selection and clicks are caught also inverting the right-hand monitor removes the issue but renders the screen unusable even more datapoints this happens in kde as well sometimes logging into gnome and running xrandr output dvi1 auto resets it but the issue immediately reappears when i press alt-tab with compiz application switch turned on the workspace is pushed back a bit and the slice on the rhs follows it as well i 'm wondering if it 's a flaw in the compiz workspace compositing configuration i suspect the error was in the compositing configuration i installed|how to resize launcher on ubuntu possible duplicate how can i change the size of unity 2d launcher icons ther is no slider bar for adjusting launcher in system settings appearance|false

gimp extended input devices settings problem i have a trust graphics tablet today i realized how to make gimp use the tablet 's sensitivity features by going to edit preferences input devices configure extended input devices and there change the settings for the tablet this works fine until i close gimp and reopen it then no input device is able to do anything and i need to go through the menus again to enable the tablet what happens is that there are two entries for extended input devices to the tablet one for the tablet 's stylus and one for its mouse not my moues but rather a mouse that arrived packed with the tablet and that is used by it whenever i change the settings for the stylus entry it works but when i quit gimp and reenter it somehow transfers the settings i used for the stylus to the second entry that of the mouse it 's probably because gimp recognizes the two input devices with the same name i can see two uc-logic tablet wp8060u entries in the settings dialog and somehow it attributes the settings i made to the mouse before it does to the stylus maybe if i change the name of one input device it will work properly how do i do that and if that does work what else can i try edit after reading a little i tried tinkering with the options found in but i only managed to make the x server ignore the stylus instance of the tablet and not the mouse instance i do understand how that 's possible as i went through everything in the driver that activates the tablet and disabled it any other ideas|not able to add yahoo account to thunderbird mail i am not able to add my yahoo mail account to thunderbird mail it shows errors like thunderbird failed to find settings for your mail  i do know how to proceed further|false

wifi disabled by hardware switch but hardware switch does help running ubuntu i have a problem with my wifi when booting after a proper shut down there 's never any wifi connection the system states wifi is disabled by hardware switch however pressing the hardware switch does change anything the only workaround i have is to plug in an ethernet cable wait for connection then remove it now a wifi connection can be established the hardware button now functions as expected this is of course very annoying first the wifi should been disabled if it was before the last shut down second it should be capable of turning it on by pressing the button which is supposedly turned off third it should magically flip the button through the wonderful presence of an ethernet cable and as a bonus it would be nice to have the state of the wifi button displayed with the little led next to the wifi button which it did on ubuntu and every other decent operating system i ran so far the hardware i 'm working with is a broadcom bcm4313 wireless lan controller now of course i tried to enable the proprietary driver for this wifi controller but it still has issues after a proper boot wifi is not connecting not ever disabling the currently active with led correctly indicating the status woohoo wifi via hardware button and turning it on again does not change anything the only workaround is again plugging in an ethernet cable and removing it well i do always have an ethernet cable with me i 'm not always at home and afaik i also need something on the other side of the cable otherwise it 's not even detected so this just is a solution is there a proper fix for this otherwise is there a software way to trick ubuntu into thinking that a wired connection has been made|ca boot from cd i have an i7 pc with 16gb ram running window 7 i want to learn to use linux booting from the cd before i install it on a hd i downloaded the lts 64-bit iso file and ran the md5sum check ok so far i burned it to cds twice once with windows once with nero in both cases the individual files and folders are visible in the directory does this verify it was burned correctly the following is the same for both cd copies i install linux i 'll change the bios but for now i 'm using f12 at start-up at first i get a purple screen with a couple of symbols no text then i get a black screen with a flashing cursor then i get a second purple screen with the name ubuntu and 5 dots changing between white and red this lasts for about 45 seconds then it goes black and i have to cut power to the tower to recover what am i doing wrong|false

application running between the two vms after running for about 10-30 minutes this application consistently hangs due to inability to retransmit a lost packet when i run the same setup over ubuntu

unacked retrans 10 lost since this has happened so consistently i was able to capture the tcp log in wireshark i found that the packet which is lost does get retransmitted and even acknowledged by the tcp in the other os the sequence number is seen in the ack but the sender does seem to understand this ack and continues retransmitting mtu is 9000 on both virtual machines and througout the route the packets being sent are large in size as i said earlier this does not happen on ubuntu kernel so i did a diff on the tcp config options seen via sysctl a grep tcp between and and found the following

was then able to evade this problem by lowering the mtu a similar problem has been reported here the description given there matches what i saw at some point with the ubuntu clients though the remote end starts retransmitting the same tcp segment over and over with the transmit delay increasing between each retransmission the client sends what looks like a valid tcp ack to each retransmission but the remote end still continues to transmit the same tcp segment periodically maybe related article|false

which graphics driver set is better to test in the long run so my computer has a radeon mobility card and compiz does seem to want to play nice with it the nets me a tradeoff i can use the proprietary drivers and get the boosted performance and take a hit to several usability items or i can use the standard drivers and take the hit to performance in favor of everything working properly i also happen to do a lot of alpha testing on a spare partition on this machine this leaves me wondering which driver should i be using is it more important to get the standard drivers to actually perform better or should i be filing bugs against unity because it does work with the proprietary set properly or both what do developers suggest that i run to benefit the project more in the long term regardless of what type of graphics card is used or is that a factor in what set should be used|x does start on boot i installed my new computer today with i5-2500k asus p8z68-v lx using the onboard graphic processor after updating everything went fine but then i tried to go to standby-mode this crashed the computer so i had to cold-reset it now the display manager does come up on boot anymore i need to login into a shell and type sudo service lightdm restart after that the login comes up normally the xorg log says that there were no monitors found i have not changed the default display manager to gdm and then back says thanks in advance|false
troubleshooting firefox and vlc mozilla plugin i may be reaching here but i figured this form would be worth a shot i 'm working with our new hp thinpro thin clients based on ubuntu but a very stripped down version of it its running firefox 8 and i was able to get vlc with the mozilla plugin installed i have a customer in my company that is looking to use our thin clients to stream video to these devices they are looking to purchase a streaming product to do so the above configuration works when i test on other web sites but this purchased solution does quite work with our configuration after some coaxing they said they tested this on a linux os but not with what we have they tested on redhat with vlc and that 's what they say they will support here is my question i hope to see what the core issue is and why there solution will not work and hopefully get them to make some code changes so it does when i click on there video the plugin starts up but then just sits there no video runs i can open vlc media open network stream and paste in the url to the mp4 and the video plays fine so the issue steams to be in the mozilla plugin i found there is a debug mode for firefox but it disables all plugins which is not what i need are there any other logs that exists or that i can enable to tell me what might not be working correctly|why does upstart need setgid when i have setuid and the user is a member of the group i 'm attempting to configure upstart to run a small utility that needs to access a tty as a system-wide daemon when run from the command-line the utility remains in the foreground and does exit until a ctrl c i 've therefore omitted the expect stanza and upstart is correctly tracking the pid i 've also created an unprivileged account for the daemon using adduser system disabled-login avrlirc on my system the tty the utility needs to access is installed as crw-rw 1 root dialout 166 0 may 24 ttyacm0 so i added the user avrlirc created above to the dialout group when i run the utility as avrlirc everything works as expected i added the stanza setuid avrlirc to the upstart configuration file and the job fails with ca open tty if i omit the setuid stanza it works so it 's likely a permissions thing if i add the setgid dialout stanza alongside the setuid it also works so why do i need setgid when i already have setuid and the user is a member of the appropriate group why is that enough for reference the upstart job config file is start on runlevel 2345 stop on runlevel 016 console log setuid avrlirc setgid dialout exec avrlirc2udp f h h t where is the ipv4 address of the local box and within 16|false

know if this is bad for whatever reason is a gib extended partition this partition is currently mounted this contains the swap partition in addition to logical partitions for the ubuntu and linux mint

if this partition setup is good or not because i was unable to create an additional primary partition 4 max but i figured since ubuntu could boot from within the extended partition linux mint should be able to as well so i added linux mint to a partition in the same extended partition as ubuntu which is in but in its own logical partition in the cfg file there are several menuentry units if the right way to go about booting linux mint from the grub2 menu is to just add a menuentry block for linux mint then i 'd like to know how to do this if there 's a better way to get each of these operating systems to have an option to be booted on startup let me know that as well i saw a somewhat similar question here but it seemed a little bit different since that user did have two operating system partitions contained within the same extended partition and i did want to just be shooting in the dark and possibly break something important by accident if any more information is needed that i have given here i 'll be keeping a close eye on this so let me know right away and i 'll do my best to provide you with whatever info you need thank you very much for any help|false

reasons why not to update an ubuntu version to a kernel version i had several friends ask me to update their ubuntu to a newer kernel without changing the version of ubuntu so for example staying in with the kernel version when having an older or present ubuntu version many users want to apply the newer kernel version to the ubuntu version they are using thinking that it is similar to upgrading a program so what i am looking for are some simple answers to explain the dangers that are pretty much bigger than the advantages of forcing a newer kernel version in a ubuntu release that was not meant for it what can i tell them or explain to them of why they should not update to a kernel when having an ubuntu version that was not made for that kernel version|windows 7 wo boot from grub i am trying

the partition table is corrupt i have a corrupt the partition table on the laptop that is running ubuntu before the partition table was corrupt i had the following partitions 2 primary partitions 1st ntfs 2nd extended 4 logical partitons that are built within 2nd extended 1st ntfs 68 gib 2nd linux 19 gib 3rd swap gib 4th linux 24 gib the physical order of these partitions was the following 4th linux 1st ntfs 2nd linux 3rd swap the logical order of the partition was different 1st ntfs 2nd linux 3rd swap 4th linux ntfs partition was big and it resided between 2 linux partitions neither of these partitions had enough space to install oracle 11g therefore i decided to a either move the ntfs partion to the left or b remove it completely and extend partition where linux resides as i tool i have chosen gparted but unfortunately it was not able to move the partition because he found that in ntfs partition there are some blocks that are referenced multiple times also it was not able to remove the partition neither because in this case the partitions that follow it 2nd linux 3rd swap have to be in his opinion also removed because the organization of extended partition is a linked list since gparted was not able to do such thing i was trying to find another tool i found diskdrake tool on pslinuxos distribution of linux that tool silently deleted 1st ntfs partition and i thought that everything was fine but diskdrake has damaged the partition in a way that i am not able either to boot from the hard disk nor to see the partitions with gparted and even with diskdrake itself fortunately i have a live cd of ubuntu and i am able to boot and see hard disk i have 2 ideas how i can solve the problem 1 manually change disk partitions and point them to the correct partitions 2 create partition table with gparted that as much as possible is the same with the previous one i find the 2nd approach less time consuming but some data will be lost because of it is not possible to place borders of the partitions exactly how it was before and moreover i am not sure if such approach would work for example if the os is able to locate files after repartitioning i feel like that it will but not 100 sure are there some ideas how the problem may be solved|notify-send does work from crontab i made a script that should notify me when there 's a new chapter of manga that i 'm reading i used the command notify-send to do this the program works when i am trying to run it in terminal the notification is showing however when i placed this in my crontab the notification does show i 'm pretty sure that the program is running since i made it to create a file for me the file was created but the notification did show here 's my script piece manga reminder created a file named newop that contains the latest chapter let new cat newop wget read-timeout 30 t20 o if cat grep one piece new wc l 1 then new 1 echo new echo new newop notify-send a new chapter of one piece was released else notify-send no new chapter for one piece notify-send the latest chapter is still new fi exit and here 's what i wrote in my crontab 12-23 3|false

trouble with ubuntu after trying to put gnome3 so everything started when i decided that i want to spice up how my desktop looked i have been told that gnome unity so i decided to try it out i referred to this website and followed the following instructions open terminal and run this commands sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install gnome-shell tl dr since i typed the above commands a lot of things have been going wrong with my computer what is going on is there a way i can still salvage my attempt to getting gnome 3 if not how do i go back to unity afterwards i did not notice a change so i rebooted my computer to see if the effects would take place the first thing i noticed was the booting process rather than showing the ubuntu logo it showed some foot logo which i presume is the gnome logo then i was given the option to log in which i did it took a bit longer than usual but excited i was for the new eye-candy i was expecting for the future what i got instead was the same basic framework for the display with only changes in the design i could not change my wallpaper nor anything major in my display even with tweak-tools what really worried me was the terminal commands i figured that i would need to update and upgrade my cpu to get all of the fancy stuff but what i got instead was the following message input sudo apt-get update output e gpg error trusty inrelease clearsigned file is valid got nodata does the network require authentication sometimes my update would work and sometimes it would not i would have to reboot many times i figured that all of this was too much for eye-candy so i decided to just get rid of what i downloaded i typed the following command sudo apt-get purge gnome-shell and i rebooted absolutely no change to make sure nothing would be too messed up from the purging i re-installed it anyways now that you guys have the backstory i have the following questions what is going on with my computer is there still hope for me to correctly have gnome3 on my computer if not how can i get back to unity which came with my ubuntu i just do want to backing up all of my files and reinstalling ubuntu thank you|synchronize wireless passwords between computers is it possible to synchronize wireless network passwords between multiple computers running ubuntu it would1 save me a lot of time if i did need to re-enter every wireless password whenever i started using a new ubuntu installation|false

basic raw fast read-only file-system offering no compression for linux i have a situation where i have 2 old 80 gb harddrives yep pata 133 on an older via mini-itx board i am running ubuntu lts the system is installed on the first drive using ext4 i am planing to use the second drive for data a total of exact gb research data distrubuted on 370 individual files i need fast reading access to this data but once the data is there i will never need to change it i am no expert in the implementation of file-systems and drivers for them but my basic assumption is that there might be something to gain in efficiency by using a file-system as basic as possible that only give me the most fundamental reading capabilities of the disk but as fast as possible in my scenario creating the file-system itself would require access to an original source to copy it from another mounted volume importantly i do not need compression since my files are already compressed zip i could try squashfs and i probably will but are there other options or have i again made things complicated and we are just talking with read-only privileges thanks|always show notifications in activity overview gnome shell i want the notification bar to be always shown when i use activity overview in some version of gnome shell maybe or it was by default so i was wondering if it can be done in gnome shell why i really do want to be constantly checking notifications bar if i missed something i would see if there is notifications when i am using activity overview to switch programs|false

i am writing an iphone notes client can i integrate it with ubuntu one first i 'm not sure if this is the correct venue to be asking this question so if not i apologize i 'm a big fan of tomboy notes and the ability to sync them with ubuntuone i like having my notes accessible across all of my computers and would like to be able to do the same thing on my phone i know there is a client for android but from what i could tell no such client exists for iphone i 'd been meaning to play around with learning some iphone development anyway so i did some reading on ios development spent some time and wrote an application that does most everything that i use tomboy for it can link to your ubuntu one account sync notes back and forth and it supports the majority of the formatting bold underline highlight options i 'm sure that someone more experienced in ios development could have done a better job but it seems to work well enough for what i need i 'd like to put it in the apple app store for free and make the source available as i 'm sure it could stand to be fixed and refined by someone more knowledgeable than myself but i 'm not sure what the rules are for such a thing right now i 've just got it on my own computers and have gone to the trouble to pay to enter the apple developer program because i have some questions about whether i can do so before i spend the money as it stands right now i 've used the ubuntu font in the application as well as some mentions of ubuntu itself and the ubuntu one logo i suspect the use of the font is probably okay but i have my doubts about the logo so some rebranding might be necessary more than that am i even allowed to access the ubuntu one notes service in this way i know ubuntu has some mobile applications for syncing other ubuntu one services music contacts but i could find mention of notes and as i said before i know that tomboy and tomdroid are already utilizing ubuntu one as a sync destination basically i was hoping someone might either know the answers to some of these questions or be able to point me toward someone who does obviously i can just continue using this application for myself as it does what i wanted but i thought it might be nice to make it available for other people and if someone more knowledgeable about ios development were so inclined to improve it sorry this was a bit long and thanks adam|viewing solidworks files is there software available with which i can open and view solidworks files sldprt sldasm slddrw i am a relative novice using ubuntu cheers|false

nvidia optimus how to disable onboard intel gpu so that nvidia drivers work other than in bios background i have an acer aspire v3-571g laptop which has an nvidia geforce 710m gpu with optimus technology meaning it is capable of automatically switching between the onboard intel gpu and the nvidia gpu in order to optimize battery life recently i installed nvidia 's proprietary drivers on ubuntu previously i was using nouveau until i realized that was only using the builtin intel gpu and wasting the potential of the nvidia gpu starting from then i 've incurred in this bug that is the system randomly freezes stops responding from time to time unless i connect an external monitor in which case everything works fine according to an nvidia technician that replied to a customer care ticket i opened this is due to a complete lack of support of nvidia 's linux drivers for optimus technology yes a technology they created according him disabling the onboard intel gpu which is usually done via the bios usually is what he said may fix the issue avoiding the automatic switching between the two gpu 's question since there 's no way in my computer 's bios settings to disable optimus or the onboard gpu so that only the nvidia card is enabled does anybody know of any way to accomplish that other than the bios please refrain from suggesting bumblebee that would be ot i 'll investigate that but my question here is if there is a way to disable the onboard intel gpu if such an option is not available in the bios|black blinking screen on ubuntu so i tried installing ubuntu using windows installer it took me 6 hours to install it and when i boot it it shows back blinking desktop i tried pressing ctrl alt f2 but nothing then i tried replacing with nomodeset big nothing help|false
