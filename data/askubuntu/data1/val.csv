I have tried to reboot it and searching the settings for it, but it does not let me connect to a wifi connection in any way. The only way to connect to the internet is with a wired connection. So how can I fix this and is this a bug or something that has to do with the version? I installed it on a Dell Inspiron 910 mini netbook. </p>

They have been ignored, or old ones used instead. </code></pre>  <p>I've read other answers on here, and I don't think this is a DNS issue, as I copied some of the GPG links, like <a href="http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian/dists/raring/Release.gpg" rel="nofollow">http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian/dists/raring/Release.gpg</a>, into Firefox and it resolves properly.  It finds and loads the file as it should in Firefox.</p>  <p>Also, it doesn't seem to be the same four files every time.  I've seen the Steam, Dropbox, Chrome, and Virtualbox repos all error out at various times.  It's always only four repos, and it's different every time.  None of them have any problem loading in Firefox, and the fact that they resolve sometimes but not others makes me wonder how it could be DNS related.</p>  <p>But at the same time, this started happening around the time we upgraded to AT&amp;T U-Verse.  I'm just confused.  I don't want to go messing with DNS settings, but at the same time I need apt to update everything.</p>  <p>(UPDATE) I decided to disable all third-party repos to see if that helps.  With all of them disabled, there were no errors.  I enabled VirtualBox, no error.  I added Wine, no error.  I added Steam, one error.  I added Chrome, three errors.  I disabled Chrome, and it's back to one error.  It seems like the more third-party sources I add, the more errors I get.  And it's not the newly enabled sources that are erroring out.  When I enabled Steam, it was the VirtualBox repo that threw the error.  When I enabled Chrome, it was two Ubuntu.com and the Steam repos that threw errors.  Then when I disabled Chrome, it was the VirtualBox repo that errored again.  I tried once more and Steam threw the error.</p>  <p>I don't know if there was an update to apt around the time this all started happening, but I seem to be having a problem where I can only have two third-party sources on at one time without causing errors.</p> 	"Something wicked happened" error in apt-get<p>Everytime I try to install through terminal I get this"  I am not able to install or update and I can't find working answer for this here.

non-duplicate	Keyboard doesn't work after waking Ubuntu from suspend, wakes automatically after opening lid<p>I have Ubuntu 13.10 installed on Toshiba P55-A5200. The keyboard doesn't work after waking it up from suspend, so I have to restart it. Also, whenever I open the lid it wakes up without me pressing the power button. This is a little frustrating. Your help is appreciated.</p> 	Why is 'libgnomevfs' files under /usr/include/gnome-vfs-2.0?<p>Most applications, including the gnomevfs headers themselves, expect the files to be under <code>/usr/include/libgnomevfs</code>, <strong>but</strong> Ubuntu has them under <code>/usr/include/gnome-vfs-2.0/libgnomevfs</code>.</p>  <p>Why? The package I'm referring to is called <a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/libgnomevfs2-dev" rel="nofollow">libgnomevfs2</a>.</p>  <p>Inside /usr/include/gnome-vfs-2.0/libgnomevfs/gnome-vfs.h` we find:</p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;libgnomevfs/gnome-vfs-acl.h&gt; #include &lt;libgnomevfs/gnome-vfs-address.h&gt; #include &lt;libgnomevfs/gnome-vfs-async-ops.h&gt; #include &lt;libgnomevfs/gnome-vfs-cancellation.h&gt; ... </code></pre>  <p>Meaning that even the headers themselves expect the files to be in that location - and nothing that includes this file will work.</p>  <p>Am I missing something, or is this a glitch?</p>

non-duplicate	Up arrow unresponsive in XUbuntu 12.04 after resuming from suspend<p>In XUbuntu 12.04 I'm facing an issue where (occasionally) the keyboard lay-out is changed after resuming from suspend to RAM. As this only happens sporadically, I haven't figured out what causes it (yet). However, a solution when it does happen is quite simple:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>setxkbmap -rules evdev -layout us -model pc105</p> </blockquote>  <p>This fixes the keyboard map, but for some reason my up arrow remains unresponsive in X. The key is only unresponsive in the X session, when switching to e.g. TTY6 the up arrow works fine. This the output I get when running xev and pressing the up arrow:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>FocusOut event, serial 32, synthetic NO, window 0xa600001,       mode NotifyGrab, detail NotifyAncestor</p>      <p>FocusOut event, serial 32, synthetic NO, window 0xa600001,       mode NotifyUngrab, detail NotifyPointer</p>      <p>FocusIn event, serial 32, synthetic NO, window 0xa600001,       mode NotifyUngrab, detail NotifyAncestor</p>      <p>KeymapNotify event, serial 32, synthetic NO, window 0x0,       keys:  4294967247 0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0<br>              0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0</p> </blockquote>  <p>I'd guess XFCE has bound the up arrow to something else, however I can't figure out what it is as it doesn't show in the keyboard settings nor in the windowmanager settings. xfce4-settings-editor doesn't show anything suspicious either. I'm running Xfce 4.10</p>  <p>Any thoughts?</p> 	13.04 doesn't load after upgrate from 12.10 got stuck with lxde in the end<p>I know there are allot of questions about this subject and allot of answers and methods of solving this issue but I couldn't find the solution or it didn't work I upgraded yesterday from 12.10 to 13.04 following the instructions from the main page, Then upgraded to gnome 3.8 from terminal. It all seemed to work fine until this morning when I got stuck with the splash screen and a something about manual recovery or skip mounting option (both options didn't work) after a not so quick browsing I managed to do the following: -purged the nvidia drivers (with 12.10 I only used nouveau since nvidia didn't work) -removed/installed/ again removed and installed lightdm and gdm -passed the splash screen but got stuck again after inserting the password (with a very blue edubuntu 13.04 logo) -finally installed lxde , this worked  Now, lxde is fine and frankly I didn't knew my computer could work that fast but I would really love to make it work as it should. And if it doesn't revert back to 12.10 as a final option.  Can anyone help ? Thanks </p>

When I click on the red X, I get a message that says a process is going on, but I don't see anything going on.</p>  <p>So how can I get the manager updater to work so I can update to the latest Ubuntu. I have a windows XP laptop 32 bit and I have Ubuntu as a dual boot.</p> 
non-duplicate	USB to UART adapter works with delays on Ubuntu<p>I have bought a USB to UART adapter with the CH341A chip on it. I'd rather mention that this adapter is polyfunctional; it can be used as an USB to UART adapter, as a 24/25 chip programmer and as an USB to PARALEL adapter.</p>  <p>The problem is with the UART adapter. I can use it without any problems in Windows (any, but drivers are required), but not correctly in Ubuntu. When I plugged it in, Ubuntu installed the driver. I shorted RX and TX to test it and in minicom it gave me back the letters I've pressed BUT with significant delays. I also tested it on some ovislink router. I was able to read the output but the the delays blocked the last lines the router was writing. Even worse: when I try to write something I have to refresh (I mean, to put the lines I've written higher (by i.e. pressing Enter)) the console.</p>  <p>So basically I'm able to read the output but not the last few lines and I'm not able to correctly write to the terminal. I repeat I can use this adapter correctly in Windows so it's Ubuntu's issue.</p>  <p>I'm running Ubuntu 14.04.</p>  <p>dmesg + lsusb: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DgIF7.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.stack.imgur.com/DgIF7.png</a></p>  <p>minicom:       <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/gC0YM.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.stack.imgur.com/gC0YM.png</a></p>  <p>(it doesn't allow me to post pics)</p> 	Wifi connectivity problem in 13.10<p>I use ubuntu 13.04 version and established a strong connection to my wifi router just fine, but it won't connect to the internet, I'm using the built in Mozilla Firefox browser.

I heard ubuntu was the most popular Linux OS so i figured why not give it a try. After a few minor issues I managed to dual boot my windows vista computer with Ubuntu 14.04 but I noticed that everything was really slow.

This is taking more than 5 secs, with no disk nor noticable CPU activity. I noticed that swap UUID in /etc/initramfs/conf.d/resume does not match with the real UUID of my swap partition, which happens to be... crypted. Maybe that is the point ?

(Almost) everything works just fine. However, the lock screen (Gnome screensaver) does not expose a UI to control music playback. Whenever I have Rhythmbox running in the background I cannot pause music playback without unlocking the screen. Obviously some package(s) or configuration bits are not present but I am not able to figure out what needs to be added or done in order to enable playback control in the lock screen.</p>  <p>Any idea what I might be missing?

duplicate	Installing Ubuntu 13.10 alongside Windows 8.1<p>I have a Dell Inspiron 5520 (8GB Ram, 1TB HDD) and I have installed Windows 8.1 x64 on it. I want to install Ubuntu and dual boot Windows 8.1 with Ubuntu but I can't (my problem isn't the dual booting process, which I can fix later using EasyBCD), Ubuntu won't install.</p>  <p>When I boot from the live CD I have no option to "Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 8" and when I choose "Something else..." it shows me my partitions which are all used by Windows (System reserved, reserved, etc..) and the one partition that I wanted to install Ubuntu on is "unusable". My disk is MBR and I think the problem is having more than 4 partitions. I created another Local Disk from inside Windows but Ubuntu just sees that drive and the drive I shrinked to make it as one partition. </p>  <p>So, right now I want to install Ubuntu without killing my Windows (if it's possible). Perhaps there is some way I can make an extended partition and use that but I don't know how to (I can shrink one of my drives but that wouldn't make a new partition would it?).</p>  <p>Here is a screenshot of GParted in Ubuntu:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/SNpgQ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <ul> <li>I don't know why the 800 GB is unallocated, in Windows, it is consisted of 2 drives (I've named them Local Disk E:\ and L:)</li> </ul>  <p>Also, when I right-click on that 800 GB partition and click on "New..." it gives me this error:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PsZfP.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>Which makes sense and is exactly what I'm trying to do but I don't know which partition I can remove so that my Windows doesn't break. Also, I don't know how to create an extended partition as I haven't done it before so I guess I would need help with that.</p>  <p>EDIT: Here's a screenshot of the Warning descriptions beside the partitions:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qGkXK.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>For the NTFS partitions the description is the same apart from that last part which instead has written:</p>  <p><em>The following list of software packages is required for ntfs file system support: ntfsprogs / ntfs-3g</em></p>  <p>Thank you!</p> 	Ubuntu does not offers me "install alongside Windows"<p>Any of the partitions makes in Windows was not recognised by Ubuntu, or Zorin OS, or LinuxMint.

During the login process I am directed to click "Allow Local Storage"(this is the website's button, not adobe's popup), which I assume directs the browser(or plugin) to store information on my hard drive.</p>  <p>Now, the problem is that after having the website store(or attempt to store) the flash data on my hard drive, nothing happens. There is no popup asking my permission if I will allow that particular website access to my local data storage. I checked the local data storage permissions through the macromedia web address and websites are allowed to store data. In fact, I checked my hidden .macromedia folder in my home folder and there is in fact a folder being created there with the name of the website I am trying to use. This folder is being created when I click on the educational website's "Allow Local Storage" button.</p>  <p>I've tried both chromium and firefox. I've changed the browser settings to allow all storage; I've checked the permissions on the .macromedia folder and ensured I am the owner; I can see that a folder with the website's name is being created inside the .macromedia folder when attempting to use Flash's Local Data Storage; I've verified that global settings do indeed allow for Local Data Storage.</p>  <p>I am not willing to install google chrome.

No "Boot from USB" option.  Someone here kindly suggested a link which reported they got added options by changing  "Secure Boot Mode" under the "Security" tab to "Legacy" but on my PC,  that option isn't selectable, ie, the selection cursor just bypasses  that selection. The only 2 selectable options are "Reset to Setup Mode"  and "Restore Factory Keys".</p>  <p>Anyone know who/where the usual suspects are hiding? How to flush them out?</p> 	Unable to boot from USB drive<p>I am trying to boot Ubuntu 13.10 from a USB Drive. I was expecting a regulation procedure: BIOS>BOOT-order-tweak>boot-from-USB. But it didn't work. I recently upgraded from a 7 year old laptop, and am not familiar with either UEFI or SecureBoot or how these change anything. From first impressions of what research i could do, the combination of said unfamiliar standards help avoid malware from doing there thing, help Windows to boot super fast and are compatible with newer versions of popular Linux distributions. So ideally one should be able to boot into described Linux distro from USB w/o disabling SecureBoot or enabling Legacy anything. The problem seems quite trivial, as it is not being discussed at all. What am I doing wrong? This also worries me a bit, because I was thinking of moving windows recovery to an external drive and freeing up the valuable space from my tiny SSD (and hopefully installing another OS there), and if I can't boot from USB...!! About Linux, can anyone also let me know if installing software not provided by HP voids my warranty?</p>

non-duplicate	Upgrading Ubuntu from 12.04 to 12.10 broke my system, completely.<p>First, I hope that this is not a duplicate, because I found my question quite strange and unique, and I don't have any idea with it. <br> These days I heard of the new Ubuntu release, version 13.10 and I am quite excited. I have been stuck in 12.04 for such a long time and it's time for a good upgrade. So...I ran <code>update-manager -d</code> and tried to go up to 12.10. (I decided to go up one by one)<br> It took a very long time to download all the required kernel and packages...and soon installing...and some questions asking me if I want to replace the old config files. I did some tweaking with that system before (changing startup applications, TMPFS, zram-enabler, etc) and I thought that it will cause a real crash if I keep these config files. So, I replaced all of them but it goes too slow and it's time I've to go to school. I asked my grandfather if he could help me to click all the 'Replace' buttons for me and shut down the computer after the upgrade finished. <br> When I was back from school, he told me that he accidentally clicked 'Keep' for the last popup box, and my computer can't function now. The grub menu is still there (made it appear by using the SHIFT key trick), and the splash screen is still visible, and I hope that the login screen is still there, or at least the <code>tty</code> so that I can still do a rescue, but nothing worked. CTRL+ALT+F1 does nothing, and I am sure that the monitor is still functioning. <br> So what can I do now? </p> 	Order in which passphrase is asked for encrypted volumes<p>I have installed 12.10 on a machine with two disks. The root partition is on one disk, the swap partition on the other. Both disks are encrypted and I have added the corresponding entries to <code>/etc/crypttab</code>.</p>  <p>During boot, it asks for the passphrase for the disk with the root filesystem. Then it continues booting and gets to the login screen before I get a chance to enter the passphrase for the other disk. After logging in, I verified that it was actually waiting for me to enter the passphrase for that second partition (<code>askpass</code> process is running). But at that point, I have no way of entering the passphrase anymore.</p>  <p>The manpage for <code>crypttab</code> suggests that the order in which the volumes are specified matters, so I changed it to have the swap disk first. I updated the initramfs and grub afterwards, but it didn't make any difference.</p>  <p>How can I specify the order in which the encrypted partitions are unlocked? I'm looking for a solution that either asks for the swap passphrase first or tells the system to wait until all encrypted partitions are unlocked before displaying the login screen.</p>  <p>Ideally I want to be able to use hibernation, i.e. neither use a random key for swap nor encode the key in crypttab.</p>

None of this has resolved this.</p>  <p>Does anyone know of any other means or software that I can access so I can watch Youtube videos or any other videos I might want to watch?  Thank you very much.</p>

duplicate	Ubuntu 13.10 error installing GRUB- dual boot w/ Windows 8 separate disks<p>I am basically completely new to Linux, so I do not have a lot of terminology knowledge right here. I built my computer last year and have a 120GB SDD where Windows 8 64bit is installed along with a couple programs like Chrome and a 1TB HDD where my games, documents, etc. are kept. </p>  <p>I shrunk my HDD by 40GB, created a bootable USB for Ubuntu, and booted into the flash drive. I selected the free space and created a 25GB / partition and then made the rest a partition for swap. </p>  <p>At the end of installation, I got an error saying that it could not install GRUB. After trying other drives, I just chose to skip installing the bootloader and look for help online. </p>  <p>Using my live disk, after trying <code>root@ubuntu:~# grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sda</code> I got the error <code>/usr/sbin/grub-bios-setup: warning: this GPT partition label contains no BIOS Boot Partition; embedding won't be possible. /usr/sbin/grub-bios-setup: warning: Embedding is not possible.  GRUB can only be installed in this setup by using blocklists.  However, blocklists are UNRELIABLE and their use is discouraged.. /usr/sbin/grub-bios-setup: error: will not proceed with blocklists.</code></p>  <p>I then tried <code>root@ubuntu:~# sudo mount -t ext4 /dev/sdb2 /mnt root@ubuntu:~# sudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev root@ubuntu:~# sudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc root@ubuntu:~# sudo cp /etc/resolv.conf /mnt/etc/resolve.conf root@ubuntu:~# sudo chroot /mnt root@ubuntu:/# grub-install --force /dev/sda</code> and got the error message <code>/usr/sbin/grub-bios-setup: warning: this GPT partition label contains no BIOS Boot Partition; embedding won't be possible. /usr/sbin/grub-bios-setup: error: embedding is not possible, but this is required for cross-disk install.</code></p>  <p>Also, here's my disk list: <a href="http://imgur.com/gmyuPDI" rel="nofollow">disk list in terminal</a></p>  <p>I really have no idea how to solve whatever issue it is that I have. I've seen people having problems with Windows 8 installing in UEFI mode, but I am not sure how to check if I did that and if so, what to do. </p>  <p>Thanks for helping a nub.</p> 	Setup with BIOS but GPT partition table (due to 3 TB disk)?<p>How can I use a disk with GPT partition table on a system with a BIOS but no (U)EFI?</p>  <p>I have a system with a 3 TB drive (no other drives and since this is <em>a remote machine</em> I have no choices here) and with a GPT for obvious reasons. Ubuntu 12.04 is being bootstrapped onto the system and this worked so far. Now after bind-mounting <code>/dev</code>, <code>/proc</code> and <code>/sys</code> from the host into the target system and <code>chroot</code>ing into it, I installed <code>linux-image-server</code> which worked fine (after linking <code>/sbin/initctl</code> as <code>/bin/true</code>). Because this is a remote machine I have to do all of this via SSH and have no bootable CD or anything. I can boot into a rescue system if it fails, though (PXE).</p>  <p>Now I know that <code>grub2</code> is supposed to support the scenario, but for the life of me I cannot figure out how to install it.</p>  <p>The boot (and root) device is to be <code>/dev/md0</code>, composed of <code>/dev/sda1</code> and <code>/dev/sdb1</code> in RAID mode 0. With <code>/dev/md0</code> mounted under <code>/target</code> I am running:</p>  <pre><code>grub-install --root-directory=/target --no-floppy /dev/sda </code></pre>  <p>which fails with:</p>  <pre><code>/usr/sbin/grub-setup: warn: This GPT partition label has no BIOS Boot Partition; embedding won't be possible!. /usr/sbin/grub-setup: error: embedding is not possible, but this is required when the root device is on a RAID array or LVM volume. </code></pre>  <p>So how can I get <code>grub2</code> installed in order to have this BIOS-based system boot properly?</p>  <p><strong>Note:</strong> it doesn't matter whether I run this inside or outside the <code>chroot</code> environment. The error and output are identical. Likely because I bind-mounted <code>/dev</code> etc into place. Of course appropriate adjustments to the command line (no <code>--root-directory=</code>) have been made.</p>

It prints but does not scan at all. It used to do everything in Windows XP and is fairly new. I don't want to run Windows any more. SANE says the MX890 is complete but maybe the MX892 is a completely different creature.</p>  <p>Finally I decided I will go out and buy a scanner that has a "complete" rating from SANE with the exact same model number. At Office Depot there was a Canoscan Lide 210 so I bought it because it has the "complete" rating On Simple Scan it scans but I just get a light gray blank image. I installed Xsane using the package manager and it does the same thing. I'd be willing to take it back and get an HP or a Epson if I knew it would plug and play and was locally available at Office Max, Office Depot,Best Buy etc.. But not all of HP or Epson get a complete rating from SANE. Therefore I'm afraid I'll be in the same situation.</p>  <p>I'm new to Ubuntu. I have it on 2 computers. I've managed to run Netflix and enable the cube. I've done a little in the terminal but this scanner thing and back ends etc has me lost at the moment. Canon does not have a driver. I'm running Ubuntu 14.04. If I have to do something in terminal it will have to be step by step and hopefully not too complicated. I guess that's all for now. Hopefully someone can shed some light on this and offer a simple solution. ...........I JUST FOUND THE ANSWER. THERE IS A MECHANICAL LOCK ON THE UNDERSIDE OF THE SCANNER. JUST SLIDE IT FROM LOCKED TO UNLOCK. IT WILL THEN STOP PUTTING OUT BLANK GRAY IMAGES. YES I ANSWERED MY OWN QUESTION. I TRIED TO POST THIS ANSWER BUT COULD NOT DO IT FOR 8 HOURS BECAUSE I'M NOT A LEVEL 10 MEMBER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

I don't want to resize (scale) the video, I don't want to change its aspect ratio and I don't want it to lose quality (this is very important); all I want is "to change the format", that's all. Reason: my DVD player won't recognize any formats other than AVI or MP4. I don't care about file size, unless the difference between the input and the output files is absurdly huge. So, how do I do that?</p>  <p>I've already tried programs such as WinFF, Arista, Format Junkie, but their presets always change something which I don't want to be changed (size, aspec ratio, etc.). I'm not really sure, but I think the best way to get what I want is to go with the pure ffmpeg commands. But how?</p>  <p>By the way, Ubuntu 13.04 (64-bit), here. Thanks for your time, guys.</p>

non-duplicate	How to format a HDD in ubuntu 14.04<p>So i recently switched to Ubuntu from Opensuse, and i'm loving it. There's one problem though. I've found that the control centre is minimalistic (to say the least) and, coming from a guy with Yast2, that's a bit of a problem. My particular problem here is that i'm trying to reformat an old HDD to an NTFS file extension, and i'm not exactly sure how. I'd prefer it if this is GUI driven, a, while i certainly am confident with a terminal, i don't like the idea of using it to reformat an HDD. </p>  <p>Now, not only do i want to reformat, i'd also like to partition it. i.e: 700GB NFTS and 500GB whatever extension Ubuntu uses.</p> 	Old PC used under Ubuntu low graphic mode<p>I want to disable the GUI for an old PC used for a server in my company to serve an ERP web application.

Toggling the touch pad using the function keys does not help, suspending and resuming it does, tough.</p>  <p>Is there an easier way to reset the synaptics driver than going to standby mode and waking the notebook up again?</p>

I tried using <a href="http://tips.webdesign10.com/how-to-bulk-rename-files-in-linux-in-the-terminal" rel="nofollow">this</a>, but I always get an error.</p>  <p>I have a folder, inside with a <strong>lot</strong> of files. Running <code>ls -1 | wc -l</code>, it returns that I have like 160000 files inside. The problem is, that I wish to move these files to a Windows system, but most of them have characters like <code>:</code> and <code>?</code> in them, which makes the file unaccessible on said Windows-based systems.</p>  <p>(As a <em>"do not solve but deal with"</em> method, I tried booting up a LiveCD on the Windows system and moving the files using the live OS. Under that Ubuntu, the files were readable and writable on the mounted NTFS partition, but when I booted back on Windows, it showed that the file is there but Windows was unable to access it in any fashion: rename, delete or open.)</p>  <p>I tried running <code>rename 's/\:/_' *</code> inside the folder, but I got <em>Argument list too long</em> error. Some search revealed that it happens because I have so many files, and then I arrived <a href="http://www.techexpertblog.com/linux-rename-long-list-of-files" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The problem is that I don't know how to alter the command to suit my needs, as I always end up having various errors like</p>  <ul> <li>Trying <code>find -name '*:*' | xargs rename : _</code>, it gives <em>xargs: unmatched single quote; by default quotes are special to xargs unless you use the -0 option [\n] syntax error at (eval 1) line 1, near ":" [\n] xargs: rename: exited with status 255; aborting</em></li> <li>Adding the <code>-0</code> after <code>xargs</code> turns the error message to <em>xargs: argument line too long</em></li> </ul>  <p>These files are archive files generated by various PHP scripts. The best solution would be having a chance to rename them <strong>before</strong> they are moved to Windows, but if there is no way to do it, we might have a way to rename the files <strong>while</strong> they are moved to Windows. I use <code>samba</code> and <code>proftpd</code> to move the files.</p>  <p>Unfortunately, graphical software are out of the question as the server containing the files is what it is, a server, with only command-line interface.</p> 	Is apt-cacher capable of managing packages which are being requested by clients ?<p>I'm currently experimenting with building a repository for our company.

non-duplicate	Lost Windows 7 files<p>My intention was to have a dual boot system with Ubuntu and Windows 7.  Obviously I did something wrong because although I had a system menu on booting (is it normal to appear DOS-like?) which gave me an option of booting into windows 7, I was unable to do so.  Also, when I booted into Ubuntu, my Windows 7 drive was not available.  The Windows 7 drive was an internal 1TB drive partitioned into a 200GB (OS) and a second partition making up the remainder.</p>  <p>I was still unable to access this Windows 7 drive even after deleting Ubuntu as I kept getting an 'requires an NTFS drive' error, or something similar.  I could not even re-install Windows 7 as the disk was not recognised.  I did eventually get the drive back by but I cannot for the life of me remember how.  I did try to recover my lost W7 data using Ontrack Easy Recovery (which has always been succesfull in the past for post format recovery) but it would not recognise the 1TB although it was now formatted as NTFS.

However, I would dearly love to recover some of my lost Windows 7 files.</p>  <p>I had resigned myself to a lot of lost personal data but I happened to notice that a 2TB drive I had connected through a USB docking station had been repartitioned.

non-duplicate	How setup samba share only readable by a certain domain group?<p>I'm using Ubuntu Server 12.04 connected to an active directory by Likewise open. I want to be able to share my files with others in the same domain group. I've followed <a href="http://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/samba-ad-integration.html" rel="nofollow">this guide</a>  and also uncommented the [homes] section in <code>smb.conf</code> file and created a new share with read permission for group members. I have only managed to share files when allowing guests, otherwise I only get an authentication pop-up, that is unable to actually authenticate with my credentials (my domain user, used to login on both Windows and Ubuntu). I've googled around and found lots of confusing information that either doesn't apply to Likewise open or simply doesn't work.  Surely I don't need to setup Samba as a Domain Controller to do this? I just want to setup an Ubuntu file server in a Windows domain. I can see the shares but when I double click I get a popup asking for user, domain and password, but none is accepted. I've tried to map the domain group to a Linux group but that didn't work either.

non-duplicate	Can't right click on an HP Pavilion dv6<p>After installing, I initially assumed that right-clicking just wasn't a feature.  I've been trying to separate myself from what I'm accustomed to in Windows, so I didn't think much of it.  I've since read that right-clicking is definitely something other people are able to do. </p>  <p>However, right-clicks, in any context, are behaving as left-clicks.  I'm using the touch-pad on an HP Pavilion dv6 laptop.  Did something go wrong with my installation?  Maybe a driver issue?  I've tried quite a few Google searches on the issue, and I haven't come up with any results relating to a complete loss of right-mouse functionality.</p>  <p>I have read that Shift+F10 is the default keyboard shortcut for right-clicking.  However, I am finding that it has no noticeable effect whatsoever when used.</p>  <p>I've checked System Settings, and I don't see anything that allows for toggling the right touch-pad button on or off.  Lacking experience with the system, I don't really know where to look next.</p>  <p>My questions then, would be:</p>  <ul> <li>Am I crazy, or does 12.04 normally have a right-click function that brings up a menu pane?</li> <li>Is this a problem that anyone has heard of or encountered previously?</li> <li>If so, how has it been resolved in the past?</li> <li>My buttons are indeed part of a click-pad.</li> </ul>  <p>I checked some of the "related" links that showed up with the page.  I checked  <code>synclient -l</code> and found that quite a few parameters were questionably set at 0.</p>  <pre><code> RightButtonAreaLeft = 0  RightButtonAreaRight = 0  RightButtonAreaTop = 0  RightButtonAreaBottom = 0 </code></pre>  <p>The same goes for the MiddleButtonX parameters, but I'm not concerned about those.</p>  <pre><code>ClickPad = 1 </code></pre>  <p>All of the AreaXEdge parameters = 0 At the top of the list, these four parameters stand out:</p>  <pre><code>LeftEdge = 1766 RightEdge = 5378 TopEdge = 1627 BottomEdge = 4331 </code></pre>  <p>I haven't tried to adjust these before.  I imagine that it could easily vary a great deal between click-pad models, but does anyone know which of the above parameters I actually want to adjust, and to what values?</p> 	How to start games in Steam running on Wine?<p>I understand that not all games will be compatible with Wine, but how do I start a game in Steam while running Steam on wine?

I have a Windows 8 Toshiba P75-A7200, and I've disabled Secure Boot, Fast Boot, and Fast Startup. Still, when I try to boot a Ubuntu 13.04 USB installer, I get to the GRUB screen and when I select "Try Ubuntu Before Installing," it hangs on a black screen. I had also tried booting in Legacy Mode, and it was the same.</p>  <p>The answers that I've seen haven't helped me, since they seem to assume I can access the Ubuntu terminal? </p>  <p>I've read this: <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/162075/my-computer-boots-to-a-black-screen-what-options-do-i-have-to-fix-it">My computer boots to a black screen, what options do I have to fix it?</a> But disabling secure boot and enabling BIOS Legacy Mode didn't help.

It completely removed everything off of my HDD and there is no operating system. Everytime I try to install a Distro it fails during instillation. I got Ubuntu 13.04 to work but it required a reboot and after that it did not work. I tried to re-install Ubuntu but it failed. I have tried Ubuntu, Kubuntu, and Xubuntu and they all failed. With Kubuntu and Xubuntu I get an error saying, <strong>"The 'grub-efi-amd64-signed' package failed to install into /target/. Without the GRUB boot loader, the installed system will not boot"</strong>. When I select try (distro) it loads up but the installation won't finish. I do not want to have to try the distro everytime I want to get on it. Any help?</p>

non-duplicate	Uninstall Ubuntu 14.04 WITHOUT Recovery Disk/USB - HELP NEEDED URGENTLY!<p>I am dual booting Windows 8 &amp; Ubuntu and I want to safely uninstall Ubuntu from Windows 8.</p>  <p><strong>2 Questions</strong></p>  <p>1) How do I safely uninstall Ubuntu from Windows 8 <strong>without a recovery disk/USB?</strong>: <strong>Can I not just click F9 upon boot and enter: bcdboot C:/Windows; bootrec /fixmbr; bootrec /fixboot after deleting the Ubuntu partitions?</strong></p>  <p>2) Is the following link a valid method to uninstall Ubuntu from <strong>Windows 8</strong>: <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-safely-uninstall-ubuntu-in-windows-dual-boot-environment/" rel="nofollow">http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-safely-uninstall-ubuntu-in-windows-dual-boot-environment/</a></p>  <p><strong>NOTE: This is not a duplicate of another question. I need to know if I can uninstall Ubuntu safely from Windows without a recovery disk/USB.</strong></p> 	couldn't open output file: Read-only file system<p>I just installed Ubuntu. My problem is I am attempting to write a log file to home. I am using <code>logcat</code> from a python module called <code>adb</code>. When I attempt the terminal command <code>adb logcat -f &lt;path&gt;</code> I should be able to output this log to a text file on my hard drive, but Instead I get the error:</p>  <pre><code>couldn't open output file: Read-only file system </code></pre>  <p>This is despite attempting the command <code>sudo adb logcat -f &lt;path&gt;</code>. For <code>&lt;path&gt;</code> I have mainly been trying just 'log' and 'log.txt'</p>  <p>I am able to write files to disk using <code>cat &gt;</code> and I can save files without issue. I have read that this can be caused by a failing hard disk, but up until now I haven't seen any other evidence of this. Any help in understanding why this is happening and how to overcome it would be greatly appreciated. In case anyone is wondering, it <em>is</em> necessary for me to output this file to disk.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>  <p>I should mention that I did in fact have a problem with my swap partition. I was getting an error to the tune of <code>/dev/mapper/cryptswap1 is not ready yet or not present</code>(not exact wording)on the splash screen during boot, but I reformatted and made a new swap partition which got rid of the error. However, both before seeing to the problem, and still now, gparted labels the swap partition as 'unknown'. <code>free -m</code> shows no issues, nor does <code>swapon -s</code></p>

With this understanding, would it be likely to find some way to install this tablet interface over the standard desktop interface? </p>  <p>In my case, I have a Dell XPS12 Hybrid - laptop with a screen that rotates and turns into a tablet. The multitouch basics work. So I'm less interested in the ideas of drivers, but more about the touch interface itself. I find the desktop interface perfect when I'm in laptop mode, but very difficult in tablet mode. Is there likely to be a system that allows me to switch between the two on my laptop?</p>  <p>Specific answers about the XPS12 are welcome, but generally I'd like to know if I'm fundamentally off the track on the idea of running the desktop and the tablet interfaces side by side on x86.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>

non-duplicate	Ubuntu 13.10 installer (alongside windows 8) and gpt partition<p>I found several answers regarding that issue but I'd still like to get some confirmation on how to behave in this situation. I bought a quite recent laptop with a pre-installed Windows 8 on a 128Gb SSD primary hard-drive . As I use it as a working gear, I need to install Ubuntu on it. While launching the Ubuntu installer from a USB flash drive (after deactivating the quick start, the graphic acceleration etc. in the Bios) a finally get there but another problem showed up as Ubuntu installer does not detect my windows 8 partition. The "other option" can be selected but I'd rather not as I do not want to break my windows 8 partition (and I saw several posts on forums where the grub-repair or boot-repair or magic-boot-repair) failed. It clearly seems related to the GPT partition aspect.</p>  <p>Because of the GPT partition on my primary hard drive (where windows 8 is installed), Ubuntu installer fails to detect Windows 8. The only solution I found for now appears to be the removal of the GPT partition (using <code>fixparts</code> or <code>gdisk</code>). My problem is the following:</p>  <ol> <li><p>If I do delete the GPT partition, will my windows 8 partition remain intact and be able to boot (since apparently the different BIOS can or cannot handle disk with or without GPT partition)</p></li> <li><p>I want to install Ubuntu on my other hard drive (which is a 1Tb classic hard drive) and let the primary hard drive only for windows 8 (which is a 128Gb SSD hard drive) so do I need to do so or should I just install Ubuntu by making my own partitions manually and then restore grub (using boot-repair for example) to go back to the classical dual-boot menu?</p></li> </ol>  <p>A long story short, the option I'd like to take is the "Install Ubuntu alongside windows 8" and no more questions asked and get everything working/launching without restoring or modifying the MBR or moving it to another hard-drive to preserve my neat and working windows partition but I am not sure this is actually possible.</p>  <p>Sorry for the long post and thank you in advance.</p> 	How do I gracefully shutdown a Juju Charm?<p>My charm controls a service that can detect when it's no longer needed, and should shut itself down.

duplicate	MySql - unable to connect as root<p>I have need to connect to mySql server 5.5 and create database using command line. Ideally it would be using a UI utility but I don't have it.  Here is an issue:</p>  <pre><code>alex@ubuntu:~$ sudo mysql -u root ERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: NO) </code></pre>  <p>However I definitely set password while I was installing MySql server.</p>  <p>What should I do to solve it?</p> 	Ubuntu Mysql suddenly locked me out<p>I'm experiencing a very weird problem here. I was using a mysql database for developing a rails app and everything was fine. Then I rebooted the computer (Ubuntu 13.10) and found myself locked out of the database with this message:</p>  <pre><code>Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: NO) </code></pre>  <p>Both the rails app and the command line give me this message. I've followed the instructions to reset the mysql root password but to no avail -- every time I stop mysqld (whether via kill, /etc/init.d/, or any other recommended method the process disappears for about 2 seconds only to reappear with a new pid. It's almost as if a virus has taken over (could that be??).</p>  <p>Anyway I am hermetically sealed out of my mysql server. Any ideas on what happened and what I could do about it?</p>  <p>EDIT:  I know how to log into mysql via command line w/ a password.  The problem is that I set no password during install and something set one for me, and I have no clue what it is.</p>

non-duplicate	usb video capture device: video displayed OK but NO sound?<p>I'm trying to digitize my old Video8 videos with a Terratec GrabsterAV350MX usb device on a Kubuntu system. Video display, and capture on basis of v4l2 is no problem.</p>  <p>However I cannot get any sound. "Playing" around with PulseAudio all of a sudden I surpringly got a reaction on one of the volume meters and succeeded to record the video sound with the following code:</p>  <pre><code>avconv -f alsa -ac 2 -ar 48000 -f pulse -i alsa_input.usb-0ccd_Grabster_AV_350-01-G350.analog-stereo -acodec libvorbis -aq 6 test.ogg </code></pre>  <p>So, in principle it works. The unfortunate thing is that I cannot repeat this anymore, and being new to consciously using PuleAudio I am afraid the notes I took while experimenting are not complete.</p>  <p>Can anyone advise which settings I have to do that I can playback/record from this usb capture device?</p>  <p>Here the typical dumps:</p>  <pre><code>~$ aplay -l **** Liste der Hardware-Geräte (PLAYBACK) **** Karte 0:

Information on this can be found here: </p>  <p><a href="http://developer.ubuntu.com/get-started/gomobile/">http://developer.ubuntu.com/get-started/gomobile/</a></p>  <p>However, they also seem to be concurrently pushing Quickly/Python as the development platform for the desktop specifically and this relys on Gtk, as can be seen here:  </p>  <p><a href="http://developer.ubuntu.com/get-started/">http://developer.ubuntu.com/get-started/</a></p>  <p>If I want my application to have longterm viability and to be portable across platforms which should I be investing my time in? Will QML/Qt eventually be pushed as the Ubuntu SDK solution and reliance on Gtk be dropped, or will there be a move to broaden development choices by allowing Gtk apps to be written in QML, and allow Gtk to run on tablets and phones?</p>  <p>It would be helpful to know what the future roadmap is so developers don't invest time and resources down a deadend path...</p>

duplicate	ubuntu broke my computer<p>About a week and a half ago I tried to update from 12.04 to 12.10 doing the sequential upgrades to get to the new OS 13.1. I downloaded 12.1 from the software center which I've been told since that the SFC was not the best place to download an upgrade.

So far nothing seems to indicate it since by default there's none, I don't remember installing any and I checked my installed software for one.</p>  <p>My questions would be: 1. how can I be sure I don't have a firewall or any other type block, I can give you other details like iptables --list output (no idea what that is though). 2. If you don't think it's that, what in hell could it be, I used to fault the ethernet of my MB but now I know it's the drivers at most.

Also, please still do "Check disc for defects" on the machine you want to install on because (1) that can reveal problems with the machine as well as the installation media, and (2) the media might really be bad, and just working on other machines with hardware not requiring the corrupted files to be used</p>  <p>@J.Naw Yes, the text-based alternate install CD might work.

However, based on <a href="http://askubuntu.com/a/3507/8724" title="Best way to cache apt downloads on a LAN?">the post</a> that put me onto this , it sounds like if I take my laptop* to a different network and update it there, the downloaded updates will NOT be automatically copied back to the squid-deb-proxy server when I get back on my network.</p>  <p>Assuming that this is correct (I will be testing later), is there a way I can stick these packages into the cache so I don't have to download them one more time for other machines in the network?</p>  <hr>  <p>* As noted in the comments, I could simply make the laptop the proxy server, but in my specific case, the laptop is actually 1) a VM that is not running all the time, 2) in a laptop that is not open all the time. As such, that solution, while a good one, does not work in my case.</p> 
duplicate	Xubuntu installer shows no partitions, crashes<p>I'm trying to install Xubuntu 13.04 on an HP Envy h8-1414 desktop computer running Windows 8. I would like to set it up dual-boot. I downloaded the 64-bit AMD desktop ISO onto a USB device and booted from it. I am able to "try ubuntu" just fine - in fact I am writing this message from within Firefox while trying it. But when I try to install it, the installer shows me this when trying to select a partition, see screen shots here: <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/masridhar/xubuntu-install-problems" rel="nofollow">https://sites.google.com/site/masridhar/xubuntu-install-problems</a> (I'd love to show the screen shot inline instead of with a link, but I don't have the 10 reputation points.) I used gparted to carve out some space for Ubuntu, and it shows me the partition list just fine. I also read in other threads on askubuntu that I should try using gdisk to check for errors in the GPT disk. But that seems to show that everything is fine.</p>  <p>I'd love to get xubuntu going on this machine.

duplicate	No Ubuntu partitions on installed dual boot system<p>I have both Ubuntu 12.04 and Windows 7 and dual booting. Ubuntu has 10GB of space and I'm running out of space. I want to increase this to 100GB, so I went to the Windows disk manager, it shows 100MB FAT16, 14GB recovery NTFS, 540GB OS NTFS. There are no partitions shown for Ubuntu/Linux in either the Windows disk manager or gparted.

They can be connected successfully. However, the connection seems to be quite unstable. In many case, after I use them for a while, the system disconnects my devices and then automatically reconnect them, thus I have to wait for about 10s for them to work again. In some other case, the software reports "the battery of your devices is low (0%)" and then I have to restart the bluetooth services in order to make my devices work again.</p>

non-duplicate	Script for an incremental file system backup<p>I'd like to run the following incomplete script weekly in as a cron job to backup my home directory to an external drive mounted as /mnt/backups</p>  <pre><code>#!/bin/bash #  TIMEDATE=$(date +%b-%d-%Y-%k:%M)  LASTBACKUP=pathToDirWithLastBackup  rsync -avr --numeric-ids --link-dest=$LASTBACKUP /home/myfiles /mnt/backups/myfiles$TIMEDATE </code></pre>  <p>My first question is how do I correctly set LASTBACKUP to the the the directory in /backs most recently created? </p>  <p>Secondly, I'm under the impression that using --link-desk will mean that files in previous backups will not will not copied in later backups if they still exist but will rather symbolically link back to the originally copied files? However, I don't want to retain old files forever. What would be the best way to remove all the backups before a certain date without losing files that may think linked in those backups by currents backups? Basically I'm looking to merge all the files before a certain date to a certain date if that makes more sense than the way I initially framed the question :). Can --link-dest create hard links, and if so, just deleting previous directories wouldn't actually remove linked file?</p>  <p>Finally I'd like to add a line to my script that compresses each newly created backup folder (/mnt/backups/myfiles$TIMEDATE). Based on <a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/52725/rsync-to-compressed-archive-of-file">reading this question</a>, I was wondering if I could just use this line </p>  <pre><code>gzip --rsyncable /backups/myfiles$TIMEDATE </code></pre>  <p>after I run rsync so that sequential rsync --link-dest executions would find already copied and compressed files? </p>  <p>I know that's a lot, so many thanks in advance for your help!!</p> 	Unable to add 100hz output with xrandr<p>My TV supports 100/120hz output.

It is formatted as a single ext4 partition (no swap), and all the usual folders are installed on it (I keep lots of data on external media, but /home and all the rest is on the SSD). </p>  <p>Today I booted it and I got a message that the drive is full. I opened Disk Usage Analyzer to look at what takes up space. It insists that 67.8 GB of the disk are used, and that / is taking up 36.4 GB. Which leads to the question, where are the missing 30 GB, if not on the file system?!  </p>  <p>Just to have a comparison, I added up all the sizes of all readable folders listed in Nautilus as subfolders of / (including the hidden ones). I got 20.9 GB. Trash was unreadable, but I know it has 16.2 GB, so the sum is 36.1 GB, around the same as what Disk Usage Analyzer is reporting. There were some system folders which were unreadable, like proc, but I doubt that they add up to 30 GB - else it wouldn't be possible to install Ubuntu on small disks, and I've seen it run on 2.5 GB. I think they must be the 0.3 GB difference between my calculation and the Disk Usage Analyzer's report. </p>  <p>So I'd like to know, what is eating up these 30 GB and how do I get it to free them? </p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/YyZBF.jpg" alt="alt text"></p>  <p><strong>Edit with answers to CYREX's questions</strong></p>  <ol> <li>Booted from Ubuntu 10.10 64 bit live CD (same as my system).</li> </ol>  <p>fsck result: </p>  <pre> root@ubuntu:~# fsck /dev/sda1 fsck from util-linux-ng 2.17.2 e2fsck 1.41.12 (17-May-2010) /dev/sda1: clean, 265956/4890624 files, 18073343/19537408 blocks </pre>  <ol> <li>Booted from the SDD.

non-duplicate	How to install wine!<p>I tried to install Wine through the Terminal, and at some point, the EULA showed up but I can't click anything. </p>  <p>How do I go on?</p> 	12.04 stuck at the login screen<p>I did fresh installs of Ubuntu 12.04 on all my computers yesterday and one of them just doesn't seem to like 12.04. Let's start with the symptoms:</p>  <ol> <li><p>I initially tried installing through a USB flash with the desktop amd64 version. Since it had worked on all other (5) computers, I believe the USB flash drive was ok. However the computer seemed to be stuck after the Ubuntu GUI came up (bar on the top, pinkish background) but before the screen prompting to Try or Install. When the screen came up, the mouse was moving exceptionally slowly, i.e. it responded 2-3 seconds after I had moved it. After a few minutes, I could move the mouse with normal speed, but could not click anything. The Try/Install window never came up. The same thing had happened a few days ago when I had tried to install Ubuntu 12.04 Beta 2 on the same computer, but when the Try/Install screen kept failing to come up, I gave up. </p></li> <li><p>I assumed it was a problem with the desktop installer, so I tried the alternative installer, which worked fine.

I have installed xcompmgr and ardesia (according to Roman's solution), but when I run ardesia I get a blank grey toolbar (without the icons showing that are supposed to be there). The buttons on the toolbar--although not visible--do work (the pen cursor shows up when I click pencil, the colors change properly, etc.), but nothing happens when I try to write anything. I have also tried using compton instead of xcompmgr. I am running lubuntu 13.10 [UPDATE: 14.04]. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, as this would really be a killer tool for making videos for my class. Thanks.</p>  <p>[UPDATE]: Upon further investigation, others seem to be having this issue with the latest version of Ardesia (1.1-1), and recommended trying the penultimate verison (1.0-1). I tried this, and while it gives <strong>slightly</strong> better results (the toolbar icons show up, annotating with text works but disappears after a few seconds, pen drawing is still impossible), this is still far from being usable. I'd still appreciate any help. Thank you.</p>  <p>[UPDATE 2]: As a test, I ran a **u**buntu (not **lu**buntu) live CD, installed ardesia on it, and ran it using compiz. This worked perfectly, but I have no interest in making the switch to ubuntu. So, I then tried installing compiz on my lubuntu system and using that with ardesia, but achieved the same failing results. Still trying to figure out what the issue might be (perhaps a problem with openbox?). I'm really no expert here, but I'm trying anything I can, and I'd really love any help that people could provide. Thank you.</p>  <p>[UPDATE 3]: Upon trying the suggestion in the comments by @fossfreedom, I got the following error from ardesia:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9xyho.jpg" alt=""></p>  <p>I then tried it a few more times, and I got it to not break down once, but it still wouldn't draw. Perhaps of note: sometimes when I quit aredsia, the drawing that I tried to do flashes briefly before the program closes. Not sure what this could mean, but I think it shows that it's not totally broken...</p>

The bios does not recognize SATA drives for booting, so I mounted a 250GB SATA drive into a USB SATA box and proceeded to install Ubuntu 12.04 using an active CD.  The installation went well and I can use Ubuntu and boot from this USB interface.  I then installed a second 500GB SATA drive into into the computer.  Using Disk Utility, I had hoped to be able to mount this drive.  It was partitioned in two 250GB partitions in my old computer, one being ntfs and the other ext3.  I had hoped to be able to install Win XP on the ntfs partition, but it does not show up.  I tried listing devices in /media/ and found only floppy and floppy(o).  </p>  <p>Can anyone help a beginner figure out how to mount the added SATA drive?  Is there a command to probe for it, or a program? </p>

However the situation is a bit special, and here's why (let's call him person A and me, person B):</p>  <p>Person A has a PC, on which he has a virtual machine, which is in the same network as the actual PC he's running. However person A is also in the same network with person B (a different network).</p>  <p>I want the site that lives on A's VM to be able to connect to the MySQL server on B's PC. For this I've thought a port forwarding would be appropriate: from <code>ip-of-person-A:3306</code> to <code>ip-of-person-B:3306</code>. This way the site would connect to the IP of the PC it's living on (not the VM), which would forward to A's MySQL.</p>  <p>I've seen several examples of port forwarding, but I don't think it's what I need, from what I've seen, it's kind of the opposite. So would something like this be achievable?</p>

UNEXPECTED INCONSISTENCY: RUN FSCK MANUALLY. fsck / [886] terminated with status 4. Filesystem has errors: /" </code></pre>  <p>Then it stopped here and I had to restart again, after which it asked whether I want to repair or not, then the system ran properly.

non-duplicate	how to remove very long list of files<p>My hard drive on my old PC is full up. It's not a big hard drive so I have to be very selective about what I keep. This is not the first time this happens, but Firefox keeps ALL unsubmitted crash reports, as .dmp and .extra files. In my disk utility, Firefox pending crash reports take up about 13GB. This is very annoying because when it crashes it never asks if I want to send a report, and it doesn't crash often so I don't know how it fills up. I tried to navigate through folders to them and delete them, but it uses so much RAM that once it has loaded, the window won't even respond to inputs. So I used the terminal, removed the space in Crash Reports, and tried to remove all files that way by changing to the directory and using <code>rm ./*.*</code> and then I tried <code>./*.dmp</code> and <code>./*.extra</code> but every time I get the same error:</p>  <pre><code>bash: /bin/rm: Argument list too long </code></pre>  <p>So I'm guessing it is too many files to pass the argument. Can anyone help me with a way to remove all these pending reports where I won't have to type in each specific report because they are very long to type individually. Thanks for any advice you may provide.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong>: This is a new account, my reputation is low on this one so I can't post an answer for 7 hours which is stupid. So i'm editing to answer my own question.</p>  <p>Actually I figured out a way to do it after I posted this. But I'm going to post the way that I did it in case anyone has this same issue, or an issue with similarly labeled files. It is all about the labeling, which are labeled using a Hex format. For example below, I copied and pasted a few </p>  <ul> <li><p>7fefb131-b757-f12f-072987c7-68919cbc.extra</p></li> <li><p>7fefd48b-d795-1714-6ce8144d-17b5e21f.dmp</p></li> <li><p>7fefd48b-d795-1714-6ce8144d-17b5e21f.extra </p></li> <li><p>7ff02020-5bcb-b5c6-276167bb-0c1fa603.dmp</p></li> <li><p>7ff02020-5bcb-b5c6-276167bb-0c1fa603.extra </p></li> </ul>  <p>So since there were too many files over all to delete using <code>rm ./.</code> What I did was this, to delete big sections at once:</p>  <pre><code>rm ./7e*.* rm ./7d*.* </code></pre>  <p>What this does is it goes through and deletes all files that begin with 7e, 7d, etc. Since it's hex you just need to go through 0-9, a-f. However, instead of going through the second part of each filename (78*,79*,7a,7b,7c, and so on) you could probably just use <code>rm ./0*.* rm ./1*.*</code> etc just going 0-9, then a-f. I hope I explained this clearly enough, I hate being stuck on something like this and I'm hoping I can help someone else. As long as you have files that follow suit like this in labeling, either hex format, or any format where a specific order is followed (<code>abc1.dmp</code>, <code>abc2.dmp</code>, <code>efg1.dmp</code>, anything like that) you can simply go down the list and take out large chunks of files instead of individual files. Good luck. If anyone reads this and has editing points, please let me know, I'm always looking to format better.

non-duplicate	14.04 LTS on HP EliteBook 8740w with NVIDIA and DreamColor<p>I have been running Ubuntu 13.04 for quite some time and though I would upgrade to 14.04 LTS as I also wanted to migrate to a larger SSD disk.</p>  <p>In the past it was tricky to install Ubuntu because the HP Dreamcolor display in my HP EliteBook 8740w needed the NVIDIA drivers. This was solved using an external monitor to install Ubuntu and then install the proprietary NVIDIA drivers.</p>  <p>When trying to install 14.04 LTS, this procedure doesn't work - all screens (VGA, Display-port and built in) remain black except for some funny coloured characters.</p>  <p>I though I could install the old 13.04 and then perform an upgrade. This has also proven to be tricky as "13.04 it is no longer supported" and a lot of references to packages doesn’t seem to be valid any more. I get 13.04 installed but have not managed to get the NVIDIA driver working. (It works beautifully on my existing installation (other hdd)).</p>  <p>Advice appreciated</p> 	How To Restrict Multiple Directories With Nginx But Still Access Files?<p>I would like to know how to let people access files with a direct link on my server but restrict them from accessing all directories?</p>  <p>Exemple:  I want them to see www.site1.com/usa/newyork/1.html I don't want people to be able to access either  www.site1.com/usa/ nor www.site1.com/usa/newyork</p>  <p>I have tried;  command: sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/site1.com ... location ~ /(usa) {    deny all;    return 404; } ...</p>  <p>But after that I can't access the rest myself... even with a direct link: www.site1.com/usa/newyork/1.html</p>  <p>Thank you for your help,</p>  <p>Octav</p>

As it would provide a major speed boost over the ancient IDE drive that I was using for my root disk, I installed it and used Clonezilla to transfer my existing OS over to the new drive.</p>  <p>I know that many of you reading this will be wondering why I didn't do a completely clean install, but this is a box that I use for experimentation and it would take a very long time to reconfigure a fresh install in the way that I want.</p>  <p>The original drive was 80gb and the new drive is 120gb, so I started making adjustments to the partition sizes; I increased the boot partition slightly and increased the extended partition hosting the logical volume so that it took up the remaining space. When I checked in GParted, although the size of ubuntu-vg had increased to 111gb, it was saying only 74gb was being used (the size of the original partition on the 80gb IDE drive).</p>  <p>I don't know the terminal commands for volume group management, so I used the LVM GUI tool to increase the size of the volume (GParted is now reporting that the whole partition is used). There is a swap partition contained within ubuntu-vg, so increasing the root partition to use the remaining free space has sandwiched the swap file like this : <a href="http://i.imgur.com/FSaegXm.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/FSaegXm.png</a></p>  <p>According to the information provided by GParted and the LVM GUI, I should have successfully extended my root partition to use all of the free space on the drive ... only other applications don't agree.</p>  <p>I have a Conky system monitor on my desktop that displays space on all of my drives, which is currently displaying the same stats as it did for my 80gb root drive. Additionally, right clicking on "Computer" in the nautilus side bar and selecting "Properties" then reports the same stats as Conky, so something clearly isn't right here.</p>  <p>Any advice will be appreciated, as I am a bit stumped by all of this. Also, please give advice in a step by step format, as this is the first time I've had to edit logical volumes and I'm not even sure how to gather the right information through the terminal ... so, be gentle ;)</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>

So my question is:</p>  <p><strong>Is it possible, to install Ubuntu 11.04 additionally to my actual configuration (Wubi and Windows 7)? And if things turned out well with the native installation of Ubuntu, too, to delete Wubi and Windows 7 from my system afterwards?</strong></p>  <p>Why I am asking this is simply, that I am afraid, that if I just format my machine and made the whole harddisk available for the fresh Ubuntu installation, it could be possible, that it turns out, that one thing or an other would not work properly, like it did in Wubi.

I've tried several methods to get this to work. Basically, I home host a server on my PC, the problem is, I want it to be online when logged in as every user on the computer. It uses multiple Terminal instances. The server uses Java. Here are things I've tried.</p>  <p>1.Create a startup script, run the servers directly, and mount devices from there. Result: The devices mounted, but only one server ran, Terminal had the same result. Conclusion: The script ran because the devices mounted, but only run one server and waited for the script to finish, but the script is set to loop so the main script didn't do anything. (Note: 2 &amp; 3 were also using the startup script, however... it was modified.)</p>  <p>2.Run server script in the background. Command: ./server/here &amp; exit Result: The devices mounted, so the startup still worked, but only one server ran, however, when I ran another server in Terminal, Terminal closed, but the server ran as well.</p>  <p>3.Have the main script boot up a program to run the servers on startup.

Of course, this has thought me a great deal of lessons of using ubuntu, the command line and Linux in general. It also sparked my interests in open-source/free software and why it is so precious. I've learned to respect the community and am actively learning my way through.</p>  <p>Now, last night I attempted to optimize my laptop power consumption and installed, amongst others, <a href="https://01.org/powertop/downloads" rel="nofollow">powertop</a>. As far as I can recall, I didn't do anything dramatic to my system, except changing the power governor from <strong><em>ondemand</em></strong> to <strong><em>powersave</em></strong>.</p>  <p>This morning the system goes into a flashing cursor in top left after boot. At this mode I can't enter TTY-s using ctrl-alt-F(1-7). So, I reboot -> Advanced options for... -> ...(recovery mode) -> root and attempted to play with <strong>lightdm</strong> as was done <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/59978/lightdm-is-running-but-does-not-display-on-login">here</a>.  Initially there was a problem with the /var/lib/dpkg/lock and /var/lib/apt/lists/lock  . So I removed the locks. Then tried </p>  <pre><code>dpkg-reconfigure lightdm </code></pre>  <p>and it worked (no error messages). Rebooted and started normally and this time even the cursor went fishing. So, no flashing, no I/O whatsoever (to a mortal).</p>  <p>Then, went back to recovery -> root and did some of the listed options, namely: check the file systems (fsck), update grub bootloader (grub). Tried to failsaveX and that didn't start either. So, back to root shell and</p>  <pre><code>apt-get install --reinstall lightdm </code></pre>  <p>I also set the power gov back to "ondemand". Also tried several other things, which are to my judgement, not worth mentioning.</p>  <p>So, quite desperate. Please give a pointer as to how to proceed.</p>  <p>SYSTEM SPECS: Ubuntu 12.10 on a DELL E6420 laptop. All worked out-of-the box with 12.10, with the occasional crash upon system update. </p>  <p>EDIT [1]:</p>  <pre><code>cat /etc/X11/default-display-manager </code></pre>  <p>returns </p>  <pre><code>/usr/sbin/lightdm </code></pre>  <p>When I try </p>  <pre><code>sudo service lightdm start  </code></pre>  <p>System goes back into black screen with no I/O option.</p>  <p>EDIT [2]: </p>  <p>After some reading and testing, the problem emerged as wireless not working. So, connected to ethernet. Then run the same commands as above (udpated lightdm) and log-in screen appeared, but could not connect. Then, went back into tty1 and re-installed compiz and unity. Then reboot and BAM - works!</p>  <p>As to the many existing issues with Linux, I could, with my lately gathered understandings and skills, generalize <strong>the main cause of errors in Linux is the keyboard operator (aka ME)</strong>.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p> 
duplicate	Ubuntu gets stuck in a Login Loop<p>My problem: As you can guess my Ubuntu is stuck in a login loop when trying to enter my desktop. Means the screen gets black and soon after that the login screen comes back. I'm a Ubuntu Newbie so if there's any answer please explain in a simply understandable language.</p>  <p>I've already read that the problem might be caused by an error depending on the graphics, so I post my graphics to:</p>  <p>My graphics: ATI Radeon 7670M</p> 	Ubuntu 12.04 boots to login screen but (I think) X.org crashes on login. Help Appreciated!<p>I've been running Ubuntu 12.04 since it's debut in 2012 without a single problem. Today I just ran <code>sudo apt-key update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get update</code> and then I rebooted my computer. After rebooting however, it first shows the Ubuntu bootscreen (with the Ubuntu logo and the dots below it) after which it booted to the command line. I could login and navigate around on the command line, but no GUI was loaded at all.</p>  <p>So I tried running <code>sudo startx</code>, but this gave a message saying (among others) the following:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>NVIDIA: API mismatch: the NVIDIA kernel module has version 304.88, but   this NVIDIA driver component has version 304.108. Please make sure   that the kernel modle and all NVIDIA driver components have the same   version.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I found <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2068331" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> which suggested to do:</p>  <pre><code>sudo service lightdm stop # to stop the xserver sudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia* # to remove all driver elements sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install nvidia-current sudo reboot </code></pre>  <p>After doing this, it now boots to the login screen where it seems that there are now two users named <code>kramer65</code> on my computer. One of the two has the default (instead of my personal) background and says my password is incorrect. The other one seems to be my "real" account and  when I type my password it seems to try to show the desktop. Instead however, it shows a black screen after which I think X.org crashes, because it loads the login screen again.</p>  <p>So I guess the Nvidia driver is still not okay, or maybe there is something wrong with the duplicate accounts (both with a username <code>kramer65</code> (but I guess it's the Nvidia driver). </p>  <p>Does anybody know what else I can do from here? All tips are welcome!</p>  <p>[EDIT] The strange thing is that I can actually login using the guest account, so I don't understand whats wrong with the specific kramer65 user login.</p>

It made it even worse, after that i now have 3 accounts listed in it, the same google account twice and a local adressbook.</p>  <p>Disabling and even completely removing my google account from the Online-Accounts settings and keychain does not seem to affect it.</p>  <p>Can anyone tell me where these things are stored? How can i wipe the contacts from the system and start fresh?</p>  <p>In case it matters, this is Gnome shell 3.8.4 (Ubuntu Gnome 13.10)</p> 	Excessive reading of hd when I hear music<p>Well I've had this problem when I was with Windows.

Anyone know why this?</p>

I installed Java 7 successfully, and I downloaded the Minecraft.jar (Minecraft fo Linux/Other) files at <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/download" rel="nofollow">https://www.minecraft.net/download</a>.  The first thing I did was drag the Minecraft.jar to my desktop.  I then right-clicked it, went to properties, made sure it was marked as executable, and then selected "open with..." but I didn't find Java 7 Runtime Environment nor anything Java-related.  I then tried running it via terminal (I forgot the command but I believe it went along the lines of "java -jar minecraft.jar").  I also tried using "sudo chmod a+x minecraft.jar" to ensure that it was indeed executable.  Yet none of this worked.    Any help is appreciated.

But then it turns out that it isn't actually Matlab, but some support package for it, and I when I try to remove it, it opens a new window asking for the directory of Matlab. I can't close it except by force, and every time I try to install a new app, it appears, and prevents the app from installing. </p>  <p>I've searched around Google, and lots of forums, but no answer related to this app, only the actual Matlab. I tried searching for the app in File System, and deleted the Matlab.desktop and still the problem didn't go away. This app has no actual directory in the file system, and it is quite annoying. Even when I tried app update, it appears after the download has finished, thus preventing the installation.</p>  <p>Now I could try to install the actual Matlab, which I'm currently downloading, but it takes too much space, and I barely have that space, because I've dual booted with Windows 7 and I have only 18 GB for Ubuntu and the rest of the 400 GB Windows.

"Not available" means that they're not accessible using aptitude (Shift+C) and a web browser just shows error 404.</p>  <p>Examples:</p>  <ul> <li>php5: <a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/php5" rel="nofollow">http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/php5</a></li> <li>sudo: <a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/sudo" rel="nofollow">http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/sudo</a></li> <li>snmp: <a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/snmp" rel="nofollow">http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/snmp</a></li> <li>openssl: <a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/openssl" rel="nofollow">http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/openssl</a></li> </ul>  <p>(and some libs that said packages depend on)</p>  <p>I know that not all available packages have changelogs but the ones I mentioned have had until recently. Though the above packages are linked particularly to Ubuntu Hardy, the changelogs of all other LTS versions (Lucid and Precise) are missing, too.</p>  <p>The subject says "many" and not "all" changelogs are missing. The changelog of linux-libc-dev is available: <a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/linux-libc-dev" rel="nofollow">http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/linux-libc-dev</a></p>  <p>I opened a discussion regarding this topic on the German Ubuntuusers Forum:</p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://forum.ubuntuusers.de/topic/changelog-der-pakete-nicht-mehr-verfuegbar/" rel="nofollow">http://forum.ubuntuusers.de/topic/changelog-der-pakete-nicht-mehr-verfuegbar/</a></li> </ul>  <p>What is going on? Did I miss something?</p>  <p>I also sent an e-mail to the mailing list ubuntu-devel-discuss (on June 4th) but obviously the mail wasn't forwarded to the list. That's why I opened this topic.</p> 
non-duplicate	Acer Aspire One 725 unstable WiFi connection<p>I installed 12.10 on an Acer Aspire One 725. There were intermittent problems with the WiFi disconnecting and connecting again and again.</p>  <p>I thought this might be an issue with 12.10. So I installed 12.04. I'm getting the same problems with 12.04 too. Which probably points a finger at the hardware or drivers for the Aspire One 725. I have six other devices that are working perfectly with the same WiFi router.</p> 	How can I merge the different keyboard indicators?<p>Presently I use two application indicators showing a keyboard:</p>  <ul> <li>input methods (iBus)</li> <li>keyboard layout</li> </ul>  <p>Is there a way to make them merge into one single indicator icon ? What I have in mind is the equivalent of the messaging menu (gathering all that is related to communications) or the sound menu (gathering all the controls for sound).</p>  <p>If it is too complicated to merge the indicators, is the merge planned for an upcoming Ubuntu release?</p>  <p>I am on Ubuntu 11.10 with Unity as my environment.</p> 
non-duplicate	Match directive breaks SSH<p>On my Ubunut server 12.04 LTS machine, I try to add a user with only sFTP or FTP access. Let's call him 'Jim' for now. Jim only needs access to a directory /var/www/example.com. </p>  <p>So far I've tried both vsftpd and openSSH, both to no avail.</p>  <p>I have OpenSSH installed correctly and I can use sFTP for my own account. But I can reach all directories and use SSH which should both not be possible for Jim.</p>  <p>I've tried several tutorials including:</p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://www.serverubuntu.it/SFTP-chroot" rel="nofollow">http://www.serverubuntu.it/SFTP-chroot</a></li> <li><a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSSH/Cookbook/SFTP" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSSH/Cookbook/SFTP</a></li> </ul>  <p>At current stage I have a user account for Jim, and he can't get SSH access. I changed his home directory to /var/www/example.com. Which is from www-data:users, Jim is part of the users group and the sftponly group. There are no changes made to sshd_config to limit Jim's options.</p>  <p>When I try to add <code>Match User jim</code> or <code>Match Group sftponly</code> and supply any option like <code>ChrootDirectory</code> SSH won't be able to restart. When I restart the service I don't get any notice but when taking a look with <code>ps -ae | grep ssh</code> ssh is not listed. If I remove the <code>Match</code> directive SSH will properly restart. Can anyone give me a hint how to finish my sFTP or FTP setup?</p>  <p>I would prefer to have a setup where ftp users wouldn't be local users but separate managed virtual users.</p> 	Start command doesn't return for upstart script in Ubuntu?<p>I have written an upstart script called 'ts.conf' for a daemon and put it in /etc/init.

non-duplicate	Brand new computer, USB doesn't boot Ubuntu w/blue-ray plugged in<p>This seems to be somewhat different than similar questions I've looked through. I'm not really a programmer, and this is my first go at using any Linux build, so I've got no clue how to troubleshoot.</p>  <p>I just built a new desktop, with an Intel i7-3770K core (3.50GHz, 8MB cache, LGA1155), 120Gb SSD (intended for OS and programs), 1Tb hard drive.</p>  <p>I used the Pen Drive USB Installer and an 8Gb brand new USB stick to create my bootable USB stick to install Ubuntu 12.10. When I start the computer, it goes to the USB just fine, I get a screen that's purple and blank except for an image at the bottom that has a keyboard, "=", then a person in a circle. Then it goes to a string of code, with the last couple of lines:</p>  <pre><code>[33.844918] ata8.00: exception Emask 0x52 SAct 0x0 SErr 0xffffffff action 0xe frozen [33.844950] ata8: SError: { RecovData RecovComm UnrecovData Persist Proto HostInt PHYRdyChg PHYInt CommWake 10B8B Dispar BadCRC Handshk LinkSeq TrStaTrns UnrecFIS DevExch } [33.845003] ata8.00: failed command: IDENTIFY PACKET DEVICE [33.845021] ata8.00: cmd a1/00:01:00:00:00/00:00:00:00:00/00 tag 0 pio 512 in [33.845021]          res 40/00:00:00:00:00/00:00:00:00:00/00 Emask 0x56 (ATA bus error) [33.845060] ata8.00: status: {DRDY} [33.845073] ata8: hard resetting link </code></pre>  <p>I can provide any other information that would make this make sense. :)</p>  <p>Edit: I tried this with 12.04 also, with the same error.

I'm following <a href="http://cberner.com/2014/04/20/installing-ubuntu-14-04-on-macbook-pro-retina/" rel="nofollow">these directions</a> to install an Ubuntu partition on my OS X MBP Retina.</p>  <p>I'm at the part where I should use Boot Repair to convert to EFI mode, but if I tick "Separate /boot/efi partition" the option it gives is "sda1." However, to the best of my knowledge that's where I have OS X files. I have Ubuntu files on sda4 (boot loader), sda5 (main partition), and sda6 (swap).</p>  <p>I'm worried that proceeding with these instructions is going to do something bad to my OS X partition. Can someone please tell me if this is safe, and ideally help me to understand a bit more what's going on here? I'm new to Linux and would very much appreciate the guidance. Thanks!</p> 
non-duplicate	How can I restart compiz from tty? (& Related, how can I set up a fallback WM?)<p>So I'm testing Natty, and Compiz keeps crashing on me. I expect this sort of thing from alpha software, of course, but it doesn't always give me the option to restart compiz, and for some reason doesn't have a fallback WM configured. Without a window manager, all my programs are still running, but they're not accepting input from the keyboard, and I can't switch between them. I can, however, press Ctrl+Alt+F1 and get a terminal, and I can <code>killall Xorg</code> to reset everything, but I'd rather just reset compiz if possible. If I try typing <code>compiz --replace</code> there in the tty, it complains "fatal--couldn't open display." Is there a way to have tty1 restart compiz? Like <code>compiz --replace --display=something</code>? </p>  <p>Additionally, is there a way to configure a fallback window manager so that there's an easier way to recover from compiz crashing? </p> 	Apt encounters errors with bad GPG keys<blockquote>   <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>   <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/30072/how-do-i-fix-a-problem-with-mergelist-error-when-trying-to-do-an-update">How do I fix a &ldquo;Problem with MergeList&rdquo; error when trying to do an update?</a>  </p> </blockquote>    <p>I always have been a Windows guy but with my recent interesting and degree (Microbiology) of bioinformatics I am finding a need for the command line and higher computational power.</p>  <p>I am making the full conversion to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and honestly just need help setting it up for my/it's first time.

However, I have had three complete system crashes (Jan 3rd, 4th and 7th) since coming back. The complete system crash is everything will become unresponsive. No mouse/keyboard input. I have a system monitor indicator that will stop updating on screen. Can't move to a terminal session with Ctrl+Alt+F1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. Not responding to pings or ssh connections.

duplicate	Windows 8 not recognised when installing Ubuntu 13.10<p>I recently got a laptop that came pre-installed with Windows 8. I would also like to run Linux, but I do not want to remove Windows, as many of the programs I use for school are only Windows-compatible.</p>  <p>I successfully booted using a USB into 'try Ubuntu', but when I went to install the only options were to overwrite Windows or 'something else' - it said no other operating system was detected.</p>  <p>I did some research into partitioning, but the guides all said to back up a Windows image (or something like that) in case something went wrong. However, I don't have any way of backing up (all my USB sticks are &lt;4GB).</p>  <p>So I have a few questions:</p>  <ul> <li>How do I solve the issue with Windows 8 not being recognised? Using the built-in Ubuntu 'install alongside' would be so much easier than partitioning myself (I really don't want to mess anything up)</li> <li>How big are Windows image backups? If they are &lt;4GB I can use my USB stick and feasibly partition myself.</li> </ul> 	"Install alongside" option missing.

How do I install it side-by-side while using the "Something else" section?

How to proceed?</p> 	Dual boot Ubuntu on Windows 8.1 : Cannot see partitions<p>I am trying to install Ubuntu 13.10 on my Toshiba E45t-A4300 laptop running Windows 8.1. After booting from Live USB, during the installation process, it <strong>does not</strong> take me into the screen with the options like "Erase disk and install Ubuntu", "Something else" etc . Instead, it takes me directly into the "Installation type" window which displays the Device, Type, Partition Tables etc. However, it does not list any of the disk devices, as you can see the below screenshot</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/BFf8J.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>I tried to run gparted, but it gives me the error "The backup GPT table is not at the end of the disk, as it should be. This might mean that another operating system believes the disk is smaller. Fix, by moving the backup to the end (and removing the old backup)?". I just cancelled this operation, as I am not sure.</p>  <p>As per instructions, I had turned off "Fast Startup" in Windows, and have also disabled "Secure Boot" in UEFI settings. I even changed the "Boot Mode" from "UEFI Boot" to "CSM Boot", but to no avail. I shrunk the C: drive on Windows as per instructions.</p>  <p>On running <code>sudo lsblk -o NAME,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT,LABEL</code>, Linux is recognizing the partitions. Strange that the installation is not able to see them? Here is the combined image of screenshots from Windows disk management and Linux <code>lsblk</code>: </p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/r5wYo.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>Can someone help, please! </p> 
non-duplicate	How to share/transfer Ubuntu 13.10 downloaded packages<p>I have 25 system which are working on Windows 7 OS and now am installing Ubuntu 13.10 in all. After installing Ubuntu in one of my systems I found there are several updates to be downloaded, due to internet usage limitations I can't allow download for each system. Is there a way to share/transfer the updates installed in one system to other systems ?</p>  <p>I have seen <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/345405/how-to-share-packages-with-other-ubuntu-systems">How to share packages with other ubuntu systems?</a> but we don't have a server with us yet.</p> 	Installing Ubuntu 14 from bootable USB with updated packages<p>I want to install Ubuntu 14 Desktop on PC which doesn't have internet.

I have a dual monitor setup and every time reboot the screens have switched places (left screen on right monitor and vice versa). I have correctly created an xorg.conf which is shown below.</p>  <p>I have tried all the solutions which are suggested in theses two posts:</p>  <p><a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/376922/nvidia-settings-lost-after-reboot">nvidia-settings lost after reboot</a></p>  <p><a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/364632/nvidia-drivers-seem-to-ignore-customized-xorg-conf-in-13-10-how-to-configure">Nvidia drivers seem to ignore customized xorg.conf in 13.10? How to configure?</a></p>  <p>including checking for <code>~/.config/monitor.xml</code> which I don't have. Loading the nvidia-setting at runtime using <code>nvidia-settings -l</code> which doesn't do anything. But that kinda makes sense to me since the <code>.nvidia-setting-rc</code> doesn't really have any info about screen positions. And since I'm running LXDE as my desktop environment "Preferences->Monitor Settings" is only concerned with screen resolution, not screen position.</p>  <p>Now here is the odd thing: When lightdm loads up the screens are initially in the correct order (as specified in the xorg.conf) and then switch order after a couple of secounds.</p>  <p>In my Xorg.0.log I found the following line</p>  <pre><code>[    11.806] (II) NVIDIA(0): Setting mode "DVI-I-0: nvidia-auto-select @1680x1050 +0+0, DVI-D-0: nvidia-auto-select @1680x1050 +1680+0" </code></pre>  <p>which I believe could very well be the culprit. It seems as if the nvidia driver overrides the settings in xorg.conf after the fact even though I'm not starting nvidia-settings at startup as far as I know.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>  <p>I just upgraded from nvidia-304 to nvidia-319 and now my suspicions a confirmed because the x-server boot log is now a little bit clearer.

I should have clarified better, I'm currently using the crouton installation of ubuntu on an Acer C720. I have just removed Google Chrome but this second application in the /usr/share/applications folder is still there, although its grey and doesn't launch anything since it's uninstalled. I tried this way (How to remove single file from /usr directory?) by using the command BUT, the file name is Google Chrome (and I've tried google-chrome, google-chrome.desktop) and I can't remove it by command because it doesn't recognize the space, so it looks for Google and Chrome separately and it says No such file or directory for both (including google-chrome and google-chrome.desktop). Anyone have any ideas of getting rid of this thing?</p>

The issue is that I am unable to connect my Ubuntu laptop with the computer laboratory of my university via LAN cable so that I can use internet.</p>  <p>When I had Windows installed in my laptop, I would go to the Lab and plugin the networking cable into my laptop's socket. Then I would Disable the Local Area Connection and then Enable it. I had to disable it because in my university the Computer Science department provides internet to all other departments and it has multiple network names, for example Network 24, Network 26, etc.</p>  <p>So every time I disabled and re-enabled the Local Area Connection, it would connect my Windows laptop to a random network and the Internet turned on.</p>  <p>Secondly, the PCs in Lab have specific IP addresses like 192.168.1.253. But I didn't need to put any IP Address or sub-net mask or anything in my Local Area Connection's properties. I would just have the settings on "Automatically Obtain IP Addresses" and then I Disabled and then Enabled the Local Area Connection.</p>  <p>Now I have installed Ubuntu 12.10 in my laptop and I am unable to connect my laptop with university network for using Internet.

It has the usual bootable partition. I want to install a version of Ubuntu. I had a trial run some days ago and when the install asked me to choose where to install I could not figure out which was the C:/ drive or the partition. I want to keep the Windows 7 recovery partition just in case I want to sell this laptop and get me a better one later on and install ubuntu over Windows 7... ie there is a partition that ACER created to house the recovery software. Then there is the c:\ drive that the OS is installed on so I want to blitz the C:\ drive and install ubuntu but keep the recovery partition. How easy is this to do?</p>  <p>Hope this makes sense Regards David</p>

duplicate	Xubuntu 13.10: How to control what services/daemons are started<p>The title says it all... Is there a GUI to control the services or what daemons are started in what runlevel? For example, to disable pidgin (instead of removing it completely).</p> 	How to enable or disable services?<p>I read about how to enable and disable services in Ubuntu and it seems that there are different possibilities to manage them.</p>  <p>The first method I found is <code>update-rc.d</code> to add new services to startup, which aims on the <code>/etc/init.d</code> folder and its contents.</p>  <p>The other one I found is to edit <code>.conf</code> files in the <code>/etc/init</code> folder.</p>  <p>What's the recommended way to enable / disable / add services and why?</p>  <p>Could you please give a short bulletproof step by step example on how to add a service in Ubuntu and enable and disable it?</p> 
duplicate	Retrieving files from broken wubi installation<p>My wubi installation of Ubuntu 12.04 is stuck in an infinite login screen loop. I have tried following the advice on other posts but nothing has worked so now I'm trying to retrieve a few files from root.disk from Windows7.</p>  <p>Here is what I have tried:</p>  <p>I booted into ubuntu and when faced with the login screen ctrl+shift+F1 and logged in with that. Updated all my packages and tried to log in the usual way again. No Dice.</p>  <p>I logged in that way again and tried to copy some files over to /media/DATA (this is a general purpose windows-friendly storage partition). Permission Denied. sudo doesn't work and su wont accept my password. </p>  <p>I got into recovery mode root and opened up /media/DATA . ls tells me that it is empty (it is not). I made a new folder for my backups. This new folder shows up with ls. cp started the copy without complaint but then I ran out of disk space on DATA. I booted into Windows and the backups directory isn't where I left it and I have loads of space left. Back in recovery mode the backup folder is still visible but nothing else on DATA is... spooky.</p>  <p>My next approach was to find something that I could use to open up root.disk via windows. I have seen lots of recommendations for programs on this forum but they either dont work on windows7, only have corrupted versions available for download, or just wont open the .disks as is.</p>  <p>So my question is:</p>  <p>How can I make data stored in a wubi disk image available to Windows7?</p> 	moving files from ubuntu to windows<p>I installed Ubuntu with Wubi.exe in (E:) and want to move all files in (D: for example) in windows,how to do it? In E: i have files like "wubildr , uninstall-wubi , wubildr , wubildr.mbr" and some folders like "ubuntu ,disk,boot,grub" I want to do it because can't load ubuntu after reinstalling windows Thanks!</p> 
duplicate	Installing Ubuntu on a Pre-Installed Windows 8 (64-bit) System (UEFI Supported)<p>I bought a computer with Windows 8 Pre-Installed, but I didn't like Windows 8, so I decided to install Ubuntu as a second operating system. </p>  <p>I'm absolutely new to Linux. I have been using Windows for all my life, but I have read about Ubuntu (and Linux in general) and I think I'll like it, so I wanted to know how to install Ubuntu  on my PC with a Pre-Installed Windows 8 on it.</p>  <p>Can I do it with Wubi or through the Live USB/DVD?</p>  <p>What steps do I need to take to correctly install Ubuntu?</p> 	Booting Ubuntu from 1 GB usb drive<p>In the tutorial it says I need at least a 2 GB usb drive to boot ubuntu from a thumb drive. I only have a 1 GB usb drive right now. The ISO file is ~ 904,000 KB, which can be stored on the usb drive. I have tried putting it on the usb drive with the Universal USB installer to no avail. It seems that this does not matter. </p>  <p>I just received a new Samsung Windows 8 laptop, and it is not giving me the option of booting from the USB stick. I have turned off the 'fast-startup' and from what I've read this should have given me the option to boot from the usb stick. </p>  <p>My end goal is to be able to dual boot both Windows 8 and Ubuntu on this laptop. I guess I am just looking for some advice from here. </p>  <p>Thanks guys. </p> 
duplicate	Dual booting Windows 7 and Ubuntu 13.10. Windows 7 isn't showing up<p>I have Windows 7 loaded onto my computer. I have never used Ubuntu before and decided to do a dual boot. I installed it as a dual boot and I had the installer create the partition (I did not create it myself). When I booted it up, it shows Ubuntu 13.10 and Windows 7. I could access both, but Ubuntu's display was too big for my screen. I found a page that said to enter: 'sudo apt-get update' and 'sudo apt-get dist-upgrade.' I did both and restarted. I got the black screen whenever I loaded Ubuntu, but I could still access Windows 7. I then put the install disk back in and said to reinstall Ubuntu with all settings staying the same. Now when I boot I get to the menu, and all Ubuntu options are there, but Windows 7 is not. I looked on the hard drive and Windows 7 is still there. I need help keeping the Ubuntu settings as is, and brining Windows 7 back to the boot menu. Thank you!</p> 	Windows 7, Windows 8 entries missing after reinstalling grub<p>I originally had Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04 installed.

As I said, I am a noob. Now, even though I though I completely got rid of Ubuntu, which includes the grub menu, when I boot my PC I am brought directly to the Grub Rescue.

And it may sound silly to start using it but there's a reason, I want to save data I have on an external hard drive that windows keep asking me to format. I don't know if it'll work, but in any case I'd like to see how Ubuntu work and "play" with it a little bit.</p>  <p>So, here's the problem. I've downloaded a version of Ubuntu on their website, so I think there's little hope that the iso is the problem. I installed it in a USB flash drive.</p>  <p><strong>Version of Ubuntu : 12.04.3 desktop amd64</strong></p>  <p><strong>Software used to install the iso : Universal USB installer 1.9.5.1</strong></p>  <p><strong>My USB flash drive has 15 Go free so I don't think memory is the problem</strong></p>  <p><strong>My computer is a ASUS Republic of gamer, laptop, using Windows 7. My processor is a Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 CPU Q720 with 8 Go of RAM and 64Bit</strong></p>  <p>Then, I restart, select boot from USB drive, I get into the menu of Unbuntu, where you can choose to "Use whitout installing", "Install", and the other options. I first choose use without installing, since I just want to see what it is. So, I select the choice, press "Enter", I get to a screen where's there's a little loading with the Ubuntu logo, and after a few seconds of loading I get to a pitch black screen.</p>  <p>Here's what I've tried to resolve the problem so far : </p>  <p>1 - Re-install the same .iso in my USB flash drive</p>  <p>2 - Re- download the version of Ubuntu I want to use</p>  <p>3 - When in the boot menu, try to find help in the help section, from which I didn't understand a single thing</p>  <p>4 - Scream (it didn't do anything but it made me feel good)</p>  <p>I've read that Universal USB installer might be the problem, but before finding a new software, I want to know if there's another place where it might be buggy. </p>  <p>If anyone can help me, I would really appreciate, I don't know a thing about Linux but from what I've heard, it can be a super OS and I'd hate to be stopped by a problem when trying to use it. </p>

I've reinstalled my Wubi from scratch <em>at least ten times</em> the last few weeks because while getting the system up and running (drivers, <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/19457">resolution</a>, etc.) I've broken something (X, grub, unknowns) and I can't get it back to work. Especially for a newbie like me, it's easier (and much faster) to just reinstall the whole shebang than try to troubleshoot several layers of failed "fixing" attempts.</p>  <p>Coming from Windows, I expect that there is some "disk image" utility that I can run to make a snapshot of my Linux install (and of the boot partition!!) before I meddle with stuff.

For 11.10 to boot, I had to add 'nolapic' in GRUB boot options.</p>  <p>I downloaded 12.04LTS LiveCD yesterday and made a CD and a bootable USB stick.  With both USB and LiveCD, occasionally I can boot into 12.04.  But many times, the boot process stuck at some point.</p>  <p>For USB boot, sometime it works.  But other times, it seems to stuck right after seeing the message:</p>  <pre><code>NMI watchdog enabled. takes one hw-pmu counted [0.408590] #2 </code></pre>  <p>The number in [] changes.  Some times it stuck at #2, and sometimes at #3.</p>  <p>For LiveCD boot, sometime it works.  But when it stuck, it stuck at different places.  At times, the boot process go directly to a blank screen with a blink '_' at up left corner.  Sometime it went a bit further, after showing options to try/install ubuntu then stuck with a blank screen with blink '_'.</p>  <p>Anything I can do to get around of this?</p>

If I include <code>nomodeset</code> and <code>grub_gfxmode=1024x768x16</code> I get dropped to a command line, If I use the native resolution of the monitor I get a black screen.

duplicate	What is used in the 12.10 full disk encryption?<p>I previously had been using TrueCrypt, but recently re-installed Ubuntu and used 12.10's full disk encryption option (re-installed for other reasons). I never got any choice in how it did that. I don't know what cipher is used or the key size, or anything besides the passphrase really. Where can I find details about this sda5_crypt?</p>  <p>Edit: Seeing this mistake is humorous, but for those curious, sda5 refers to the hard drive and partition, not the encryption system.</p> 	What sort of encryption is used?<p>What encryption is used in a default Ubuntu full hard drive encryption and is it possible to specify another?</p>
