how to remove all traces of kde installed i have 2 computers with ubuntu but on both i installed kde to have another option for the users since unity has come along very well there has not been a need to use kde for a while now how can i delete all kde related packages with one single sweep freeing space and anything kde related in ubuntu including overwriting the logo of ubuntu when the pcs start or shutdown since after installing kde the kubuntu logo is the default one how to revert back completely from all kde stuff with a simple short command line or gui tool note i ask this because it is

how do i fix netflix requiring silverlight update i 'm running ubuntu lts 64-bit which i installed using the original release not the newer release and have been successfully using netflix-desktop ever since the ppa repository was made available i never encountered any problems whatsoever until a couple of days ago it appears that netflix now requires an update to silverlight and i have been unsuccessful in updating silverlight with the patched wine being used for netflix-desktop i 'm hoping an update will be available through the repository mentioned above until then however does anyone have a solution for upgrading silverlight|netflix wont work without new silverlight update ive looked through the answered questions here and none of the solutions work i 'm running ubuntu 64 bit on a system 76 lemur ultra netflix was working fine up until about 2 or 3 days ago where it now prompts me to update silverlight the title selection screen of netflix desktop comes up just fine when launched from the terminal there are no errors ive tried to fix this problem by uninstalling and re installing netflix-desktop using the sudo apt-get purge remove netflix-desktop ive tried uninstalling netflix-desktop with the above command and uninstalling the ehoover ppa with sudo remove ppa and then reinstalling them both according to the guide you can find just about anywhere ive tried installing the silverlight exe and running it it is also not effectual in searching i have found this proposed solution that was applied about 2 months ago the new version of netflix desktop moves the profile location from netflix-desktop to wine-browser you might try the wine-browser folder and relaunching netflix-desktop or redbox-desktop so that it creates a new profile but i have no idea how to the wine-browser folder if nothing else how do i find and that folder so i can try relaunching netfix desktop otherwise are there any other work arounds to get netflix running or is there somewhere i can find an updated ppa i 'm pretty sure all my stuff is up to date but am willing to run whatever tests anyone recommends to verify this a lot of people are having this problem so i dont think its a bug and its happening very recently so i dont think its the same problem as last february though im hoping it has the same solution thanks for your time and hopefully your answers|true

how to bypass try it install screen when booting from usb live session without installing in the usb this has been asked several times already i found it here here and here but basically everyone simply recommend to perform a full install to the usb stick but i do need it to stay as a live session not a full install on usb for a number of reasons the most important one being that using live session i can easily install ubuntu using the desktop icon so my constraints for skipping the welcome screen and automatically choose try ubuntu option are it must actually be the ubuntu live session or as close to the default as possible same software selection gparted is present in live sessions gimp is not for example user name and id behavior no login screen no password for sudo to name a few no grub that rules out an ubuntu full install on usb it must be able to install ubuntu in the computer while full install requires the iso file an additional usb stick and the hassle of startup disk creator if possible to be as fast as the text-based launcher the one you have when you press a key right after the kernel loads it must be completely automatic unattended from boot to desktop select a different language than default it can be a hard-corded selection actually it must since boot itself shall be fully unattended but preferably be easily changed easily as in editing a config file then rebooting is it possible the proposed great solutions that i 've ruled out so far are installing ubuntu in the usb stick for all of the above mentioned reasons remove ubiquity package it removes the ability to install the system from that usb as well ubuntu customization kit ubk several limitations and caveats and its not even in the repos remastersys lili its the same as full direct usb install only customized an ideal solution would be something like create usb sick using startup disk creator then open it and remove edit add file s xxx yyy zzz|remove install dialog from ubuntu usb stick possible duplicate how to bypass try it install screen when booting from usb live session without installing in the usb i 've created a ubuntu booting usb stick is it possible to remove the install ubuntu dialog that appears everytime i boot from the usb stick|true
